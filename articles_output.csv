By Mike Larson
If you come across a rattlesnake in the woods, don’t pick it up. Sounds obvious, right? But many traders fail to understand how that principle applies to their “buys” and “sells.” So says John Carter, founder of ‪@SimplerTrading‬, long-time market educator, and author of Mastering the Trade, in this week’s MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast.

Transcript

Larson: The Squeeze. Unbalanced butterflies. Zero DTE options. Anchored VWAP. These are just some of the trading concepts, strategies, tactics, and vehicles you'll come across on Simpler Trading's website and X feed. But what are they? How can you use them to maximize your own returns? Why are many of today's traders turning to community-based help and mentorship? And what are key indicators saying about the health and future direction of this market?
That's what we'll cover in this week's MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast. It features one of the sharpest traders in the business, John Carter, founder of Simpler Trading. Welcome to the show, John.
Carter: Thanks for having me. Good to be here.
Larson: Yeah, glad you could do this one. Just for people who might not be familiar with your background or Simpler Trading, why don’t you talk a little bit about how you got into this business and what it is that Simpler Trading does?
Carter: Yeah. I got interested in this because my father was a stockbroker, so I kind of hung around it growing up as a teenager. Then at some point, I got into the working world and started doing the math. Like, “Wow, I'm making X amount of salary per year... but in trading, you know, I might make $1,000 or $2,000 here and there.” And it just made a lot more sense.
So, that really got me on to this path. And I took about eight years of ups and downs – great ups, horrible downs – to kind of get into this thing of let's look at things like asymmetrical risk, i.e. Butterflies. Let's look at things like, how do you do this in a way where you don't get kind of trapped by your own emotions and dopamine addictions and things like that.
So, the idea with Simpler Trading, I kind of call it a human AI-based community where you have a lot of traders from different backgrounds with different perspectives on the market, and all of us are offering our current picture of the market. The opinions we’re expressing are based on the trades that we’re taking and what we think the market's going to do.
And then it's using our experience over the years. We'll see somebody come in, and you know they'll get really excited about something, and you can tell that they're doing the wrong trade. And we just try to save them that heartache. The biggest thing I'll see is somebody gets on a good streak, and instead of attributing it to just probabilities and where they are, you know, suddenly they're a genius. And then all this money they made goes away - and that's always heartbreaking.
So, there's things like that that we see and try to prevent and just make it a community. You know, trading is always about the next trade. The previous trades don't matter. It's the next trade. Are you present? Are you in alignment with what's happening? And can you execute in a non-emotional way?
Larson: Got it. I'm definitely going to talk about the big picture for the markets in a minute. But I do want to kind of zero in on the point you're making. What are some of the mistakes that you see traders consistently making in this market in particular? And what is it that you're trying to do to help them break out of that pattern?
Carter: Probably the biggest thing is that somebody will read an article about something that was bad news, you know, about the economy. And then, all of a sudden, they're like, ""You know what? This market's going to crash."" And then they put their entire account on puts on SPY that expire in four days. And then they just don’t understand why the market keeps going up.
So that's probably the biggest thing. You read something, you get an idea of what the market should do, and then you try to impose your will on the market. Of course, the market doesn't care, right? So, that's probably the biggest thing.
And then from there it's just kind of understanding like, hey, you know if you're bullish on Tesla (TSLA), and especially if you're doing options, you know there's different ways to kind of structure the trades so that you have a better probability of success. You know, something like buying a 10-Delta call works. When it works, it works great. But it's a very rare time that it's going to work great.
And so, it's just kind of getting into the idea of creating a consistent income from trading instead of always chasing, like, the big hit and things like that too.
Larson: What's interesting, I know Jonathan McKeever couldn’t be with us, but one of the things I saw him post on Twitter the other day, a couple weeks ago, was that he wasn't seeing a lot of good setups. The market wasn't doing much. And he's like, ""This reminds me, I just need to be patient"" - and it seems like that's a good bit of advice, too.
Carter: Yeah, and Jonathan's really good about that. He's brought in his experience in the Air Force. He has brought in a lot of discipline. And he's kind of like, ""Look, if it gets to this level, I'm going to take action. And if it gets to this level, I’m going to take action. And if it's not, I ain't doing nothing.""
I don't think he says the word “ain't,” but that's a really good, disciplined approach. And that's probably the final piece of the puzzle for a lot of traders, is just to learn to be patient. Wait for that fat pitch - because if you're not, it's easy to get distracted. You can be distracted on some trade that you really shouldn't be in, you're trying to work your way out of it. Meanwhile, you're going to completely be distracted and miss the fat pitch that’s setting up at 9:30. And you're just going to miss that because you're piddling around with those little things - and that's a very common thing I see as well.
Larson: So, I want to talk a little bit about the idea of using community-based feedback and coaching for traders. I've had other speakers I've talked to, and people who run apps where you can bounce ideas off each other and use social media and so on. That seems a lot more popular these days. I'm curious as to why that is and what's more effective about learning that way versus some of the other things you can do to teach yourself trading, like reading a book or whatever.
Carter: Yeah, I think it's good to have a little bit of both. I think the community aspect of trading, it's really to kind of protect yourself from yourself. Because it's easy - you can kind of get into this closed loop. If you're just by yourself and trading, you can convince yourselves of things that just aren't happening. And you're just going to get this feedback loop that just makes it so everything you do doesn't work. It's like, well, why? What am I seeing? What am I doing here? What am I not seeing?
Well, if you've got a group, at least - and it's not about a herd mentality. It's like, hey, Tesla (TSLA) gapped up this morning after earnings. It's up 30 points. And someone in the room was like, ""I think I'm going to sell call credit spreads here."" And we're all like, ""You're insane! The stock has had a two times expected move for a reason. It’s being revalued. Why would you want to step in front of that?""
And I just think that trading is a lot like, if you're walking in the woods and you see a rattlesnake. Just because you see the rattlesnake, doesn't mean you need to bend over and pick it up. It's probably not a good idea. And in trading, you can look at a chart and you can always find a reason to trade. But the reality of it is, you want to just hone in and identify what are the high-probability setups. And a lot of times that means patience, specific things to wait for, instead of just willy nilly like, “Oh, you know, if the stock's up, I'm going to short it.”
Larson: Yeah. Let's talk about a couple of the tactics. You briefly touched on butterflies earlier. You mentioned, and obviously, the Squeeze is something you're known for. How do some of those processes work? And what's the benefit of getting involved as a trader?
Carter: Well, on something like the Squeeze – which is nice, and this is something I noticed a long time ago – is that about 80% of the time, the market actually doesn't do very much. It's kind of stuck in a range. And 20% of the time, it'll have these fantastic moves. The challenge is that if you get into this period with these fantastic moves, and then you keep applying those strategies to a time when the market is quiet, you're going to get killed.
So, the Squeeze is simply an indication of, hey, the market has gone through a period of nothing. It's now gotten to the point where the volatility has compressed and it’s gonna have to release energy. What it's doing is, it's pinpointing for you the moments in time where you're much more likely to have these bigger moves.
So, that's what I like to wait for. I'm certainly looking for that on the indexes. But if there isn't one on the index, then yeah, I'm going to go look at Nvidia (NVDA). Or is there one on Tesla? But the best kind of trades are when the indexes are in a squeeze, and then kind of the strongest stocks and the strongest sectors are in a squeeze. If you can be patient for those, you can make more on those trades. That can make your month or your quarter, versus just trying to, like, scalp here and there for nickels.
Larson: Yeah. I want to ask another question about investment vehicles. Obviously, we've gone from quarterlies to monthlies to weeklies to daily options. We used to have ETFs that were 1X, 2X, 3X. Now there's levered individual stock ETFs that kind of eliminate the whole diversification thing.
What are your thoughts on all these developments? Are they positives? Are there new risks involved that people need to be aware of when trading this stuff?
Carter: Well, the biggest thing that's happening that I've noticed – especially with the 0DTE SPX – is that it allows a lot more hedging capability. So, what will happen now is that if someone, say - mostly funds - if they've got a big long position, instead of having to sell in and out of it or buy longer-dated puts, they'll just buy puts for today. They're going to hedge their risk for today, because it's so cheap to do it day by day.
And so, that absolutely controls the market. And I think it's one of those things where we’ve just got to realize that from a day-to-day basis, as retail traders, we're in the middle of this Goliath amount of hedging that's going on. So, once in a while, yeah, you're going to get some kind of a nice move. But like, today, there's a lot of hedging around 5,800. What do we do? We hung around 5,800 on the SPX even though, you know, Tesla is up 50 points on the day.
So that's the biggest thing, is that this market isn't about buying and selling. It's much, much, much more activity about hedging and protecting large portfolios.
Larson: Let's pivot a little bit to the broad markets then. I have everybody from economists to strategists to fund managers to sector analysts on the podcast. But obviously, you're a technically driven trader. So, you're going to look at things differently. What are you seeing out there in terms of evaluating this market and its health or lack thereof?
Carter: Well, I think it's one of those things where there's certainly a lot of divergences happening in the market right now, they're all over the place. We've had a great run in the markets. I do think we're kind of at a point where it's time for the market to catch its breath. I mean, as we're talking right now, the S&P is at about 5,800.
I think we're kind of near the upside for the near term, and there's more risk to the downside. There's going to be certainly that “hurry up and wait” for the election, which is only now a week away. A little bit of hurry up and wait for that. So, I think we're going to kind of be a little quiet into the election. We'll see some volatility after it.
And then from there, it just kind of goes back to, how's the business environment? Are we hiring? Are we lowering rates? You know, all those different things. But I do think that the magnificent up moves that we've seen are certainly going to take a breather.
Larson: Yeah. Because that was going be the next question. Obviously, everybody talks about seasonals, a Santa Claus rally, whatever. But I was kind of curious if you thought we used that gas up already or not.
Carter: You know, I lean towards that. I'm always willing to say I stand corrected, especially if the market's making new highs. But I do think that the markets are smart. They front-run things. The idea that rate cuts and things like that have already been priced into the market. There are times when the market reaches a certain point, it just needs to cruise and catch up for a while. And that's kind of where I think we are.
Larson: Let me shift to a couple other things. You've talked about gold, and when we've had you at a couple of previous events, you did identify that as being a positive pattern and a positive outlook - and clearly, that’s paid off. What are your thoughts on things like gold, which has run quite a bit this year, obviously?
Carter: Well, I think gold is front-running the next move by the Fed, which I do believe in about a year or so they're going to have to start back into heavy Quantitative Easing. So, gold is really good at front-running that. We're sitting here getting close, and we're probably going to kiss $3,000.
For a long time, we saw gold kind of sitting between, you know, $1,600 and $1,800 an ounce. That has stair-stepped up. And I think the new normal is going to be $2,400-2,700 an ounce as kind of a base. And then it just keeps working higher from there.
I personally am not a fan of trading the miners. And I know a lot of people are. I will trade gold, whether it's GLD or gold futures. And then I collect coins, like rare coins, pre-1932 gold. So I do like, you know, stacking the metal.
But I think it's one of those where the biggest thing that's going to be coming forward is a kind of a loosening of liquidity. That's a currency debasement for the dollar. And, you know, things like gold go up in that situation.
Larson: In the time we have left, is there anything else that I haven't mentioned that looks particularly either promising or dangerous to you when you look at the markets overall?
Carter: Yeah. That's interesting. I mean, I like the terms “promising and dangerous.” And I think that the biggest thing we just have to look at is interest rates. I think there's maybe an assumption right now that there's going to be all these rate cuts and everything's going to be all rosy again.
But what's interesting is after the last rate cut, interest rates have come right back up again. So, there's this underlying thing where the economy is strong. Inflation is still kind of out there, although I think it's over - we're not going to see a 1970s repeat. But I think the danger here is just assuming that with rate cuts, the market's going to go straight up.
I think the market's already priced a lot of that in. And this becomes a trading market literally. I'm always a fan of long term, yeah, dollar-cost average, throw money at an index fund. But for trading, we're entering an environment where you just want to be flexible. You know, it's not always buying the dip. Sometimes it's going to be shorting the rally and just making sure that you're kind of fluid in that environment.
Larson: Last question then. Obviously, you're going to be joining us for the 2024 MoneyShow Masters Symposium. It's going to be in Sarasota this December. For viewers who are watching this, what’s maybe a sneak peek at what they're going to learn when they attend your session, or what might you be talking about?
Carter: Sure. There are two things I always like to cover. One is kind of what’s setting up right now? Like, okay, these are trades I'm going to be taking. I’m probably talking on Thursday or Friday, and I'm going to talk about trades that are setting up for the next week and the next month, and exactly kind of what I'm looking at there.
But I also like to talk about the bigger picture, because there are things like the real estate cycle. Actually, the next 18.5-year real estate cycle is coming to an end in the next year or two. The last time that happened was in 2008. So, what is that setting up for now? What opportunities could that create?
And so, a combination of kind of macro, where we are and the bigger-term opportunities that's going to create. Then it's kind of coming down to what are some good trades over the next couple of weeks: what sectors, what specific stocks. That's a good way to look at the overall market, learn about a specific strategy, and then see how it's applied to specific stocks.
Larson: Well, that's a great place to wrap up on. John, thank you so much for your insights.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732457-skywest-attractive-shielded-business-upside-to-stock-prices,4732457,SkyWest: An Attractive Shielded Business With Upside To Stock Prices,"Summary

 -  SkyWest stock has doubled over the past twelve months.
 -  The company has a beneficial cost set up that largely shields it from fluctuations in fuel prices.
 -  The company should be able to fly the full contracted capacity by mid to end 2025.
 -  I am Dhierin Bechai. Using my Aerospace Engineering expertise, I provide a data-driven approach to investing ideas in the growing aerospace, defense and airline industry. I run the investing group The Aerospace Forum.


SkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW) reported third quarter earnings on the 31st of October, with Q3 2024 earnings being 3.75x the prior year third quarter earnings. Last year, I marked SKYW stock a buy and since then, the stock has gained 113.3% easily outperforming the 26.3% return of the S&P 500. Also, since my last report covering SkyWest from August the outperformance has been strong with a 36% increase in stock price compared to a 2.1% for the S&P 500. In this report, I will discuss whether there is any additional upside from there.

A Straightforward Investment Case For SkyWest

In a previous report, I already discussed the attractiveness of the business. So, I won't repeat every detail but the investment case for SkyWest leans on the fact that major cost items such as fuel costs are passed through to the airlines that SkyWest has capacity agreements with. SkyWest also has minimum guarantees in their capacity purchase agreements, which provides a shielding to their revenues. Improving pilot availability currently drives revenues as the variable payments of the contract flying agreements are increasing. Putting it together, it means that there is more upside to revenues than to costs. Currently the company expects that by mid to end of 2025 it can fly all contracted capacity as pilot shortages further ease. However, one watch item is the significant wait time for MRO. As flight activity has increased globally driving demand for spare parts and maintenance, we also see that MRO providers have had some trouble letting airplanes flow through the MRO process fast. So, we should be mindful about airplane availability becoming a limiting factor to growth rather than pilot availability.

SkyWest Results Surge As Pilot Availability Improves Further



Third quarter revenues grew 19.1% to $912.8 million. Revenues from flight agreements increased 19.1% and lease, airport services and other revenues grew 20.7% to $29.3 million. Growth was underpinned by a 15% increase of block hours with a 20.4% increase for the E175 fleet and a 21% increase for the CRJ900 fleet. The company also recognized $19 million in previously deferred revenues.
Operating expenses increased by 9% to $781.35 million driven by higher salaries and wages, but the capacity purchase agreement have been adjusted to absorb the higher labor costs.

SkyWest Stock Is Still A Strong Buy



To determine multi-year price targets The Aerospace Forum has developed a stock screener which uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows and the most recent balance sheet data. Each quarter, we revisit those assumptions, and the stock price targets accordingly. In a separate blog, I have detailed our analysis methodology.
Unfortunately, SkyWest does not publish a cash flow statement in its 8K filing and the 10Q has not been released yet. As a result, when determining the stock price, we have to use the filing from the prior quarter and the most recent estimates on EBITDA and free cash flow. EBITDA estimates have gone up by less than a percent for 2024 and by 0.2% and $0.3% in 2025 and 2026 respectively. The CAGR for EBITDA is strong at 18% while free cash flow is expected to grow 6.3% annually. Valuing the company in line with peers, which provides a more conservative valuation case, provides a $122 price target representing 20% upside. This provides a lift of $12 per share to the price target. Interestingly, Wall Street analysts have a buy rating on the stock but the average price target only provides about 1% upside.

Conclusion: SkyWest Stock Is Upgraded To Strong Buy

Year-on-year earnings almost tripled, but that doesn't mean that we see any chance for the company to triple the stock price. The recovery path was already anticipated by analysts and paved the way for significantly higher stock price projections for this year as well as future years. However, with the current projections I still see additional upside for the stock that warrants maintaining a strong buy rating.

 -  Enbridge reported a very robust set of Q3 results, confirming the preferred dividends enjoy an excellent coverage ratio.
 -  The Series 5 preferred shares offer a 6.96% preferred dividend yield in USD.
 -  I'm planning to write put options on the common shares and further expand my position in preferred securities.
 -  I am the Investment Doctor. My focus is on dividend and growth companies. I run the investing group European Small Cap Ideas where I identify undercovered European investment opportunities.


Introduction

In my previous articles on Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) (TSX:ENB:CA) I was always a bit torn between buying the preferred shares or the common stock. But in Enbridge’s case, it doesn’t have to be an or/or situation and an and/and situation is perhaps the best approach. Shareholders can speculate on capital gains using the common shares while the preferred shares offer excellent visibility when it comes to incoming cash flows. In this article I’ll have another look at the company’s distributable cash flow and what this means for the preferred (and common) dividend coverage ratios. You can read all my previous coverage on Enbridge here.

The DCF remains very strong – and that’s good news for preferred shareholders

The net income isn’t very important for an infrastructure company like Enbridge as the sustaining capex tends to be substantially lower than the depreciation and amortization expenses. This doesn’t mean the income statement is useless as it provides useful insight in the company’s operating cost structure and the impact of increasing interest rates and interest expenses.
As you can see below, Enbridge reported total revenue of C$14.9B in the third quarter of this year, and the company generated a positive operating income of C$2.22B, a substantial increase from the C$1.8B in Q3 2023. On top of that, total income from equity investments also increased while Enbridge also recorded a non-recurring income of C$376M related to unrealized FX gains and a defined pension credit.
On the other hand, the interest expenses clearly increased, both in Q3 as well as in the first nine months of the year. Despite this, the net income of C$1.45B remained very robust (as the higher operating income more than fully absorbed the higher interest expenses) and the total net income attributable to Enbridge was C$1.39B. From that result we still need to deduct the C$98M in preferred share dividends, resulting in a net profit of C$1.3B attributable to the common shareholders of Enbridge.
Based on the company’s income statement, the preferred dividends enjoy excellent dividend coverage ratios.
Based on the DCF performance, the preferred dividends enjoy an even better coverage ratio and the explanation is pretty straightforward. As you can see below, the total amount of maintenance cape incurred in the third quarter was just C$290M while the total amount of depreciation and amortization expenses exceeded C$1.3B for the quarter.
That explains why the DCF was approximately C$2.6B, and considering the total amount of preferred dividends is less than C$100M the preferred dividends are very well covered by both the reported net income as well as the DCF.

Highlighting another preferred issue

In my previous articles I mainly focused on the preferred shares issued in Canadian Dollars but Enbridge obviously also has USD-denominated securities in its capital stack. And as explained in my previous article:
One of Enbridge’s USD-denominated preferred shares recently saw its preferred dividend rate reset for another period of five years. The Series 5 preferred shares ( TSX:ENB.PF.V:CA) (OTCPK:EBGEF) recently saw its preferred dividend rate reset in March for a five-year period. This means owners of the Series 5 preferred shares are guaranteed a quarterly preferred dividend of US$0.41769 per share. This represents an annualized preferred dividend of just over US$1.67 per share.
Considering those preferred shares are currently trading at $24/share, the current yield is approximately 6.96%, locked in for the next 4.5 years.
When the preferred dividend will be reset in the first half of 2029, it will yield 282 bps above the five-year US government bond yield. The current five-year US Treasury yield is 4.22% which means the Series 5 preferred shares of Enbridge will provide a yield that’s just over 270 bps higher for the next 2.5 years. And even if the five-year US Treasury yield would fall back to 2%, the preferred shares would still yield 4.82%, resulting in a yield of 5% based on a US$24 purchase price.

Investment thesis

In the first nine months of the year, Enbridge reported a total DCF of C$4.15 per share and remains on track to report a full-year DCF of C$5.4-5.8 per share, which means the stock is currently trading at just around 10 times the DCF. The preferred dividends are extremely well covered, and given the recent weakness in the common shares of Enbridge, I think a combination of preferred shares and common shares could be the best path forward.
I currently have a long position in (ENB.PR.Y:CA) but I'm considering writing put options on the common shares of Enbridge while I’m also entertaining the idea of initiating a long position in the Series 5 preferred shares to gain exposure to the USD-denominated preferred shares of Enbridge with a yield of almost 7% locked in for the next 4.5 years.

AMD: Investors Nearly Sent It Back Into A Bear Market

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) endured a torrid week as investors hammered AMD following its guidance at a recent earnings scorecard, which likely didn't inspire sufficient confidence. In my bullish pre-earnings AMD update, I underscored my conviction about why the Lisa Su-led company is well-placed as the dark horse in the AI chips race against market leader Nvidia (NVDA).
While I recognized significant challenges in AMD's attempt to scupper Nvidia's ecosystem dominance, I assessed its valuation isn't aggressive. Notwithstanding my optimism, the market's negative reaction this week has threatened to unhinge my bullish proposition. Accordingly, AMD has plunged almost 20% from its October 2024 highs through this week's lows, potentially revisiting a bear market.

AMD Raised Its AI Revenue Guidance, But Investors Wanted More



In AMD's Q3 earnings release, CEO Lisa Su highlighted the significant growth momentum in the company's data center segment. Accordingly, AMD's data center revenue growth surged by more than 120%, reaching $3.55B in Q3. Its client segment has also recovered, delivering a 29% YoY increase in revenue. However, the market is likely disappointed, as AMD upgraded its AI revenue outlook from $4.5B to just $5B for FY2024. Given AMD's much lower AI revenue base than Nvidia's dominance, I assess that the market is justified in asking for more. Furthermore, AMD's forward revenue guidance was below Wall Street's estimates, suggesting potential upside risks in 2025.
Management emphasized its confidence in anticipating a $500B TAM for the AI accelerator market through 2028, indicating a CAGR of 60%. However, AMD's near-term outlook has not sufficiently captured its long-term optimism, highlighting execution risks even as it ramps up its MI300 series attributed to significant hyperscaler demand.
AMD alluded to supply chain challenges, given robust demand dynamics. Hence, it has also increased execution risks for the company, potentially affecting its production and shipment cadence in 2025. Therefore, investors are urged to scrutinize the company's capacity planning parameters through 2025 to assess the company's ability to continue capturing market share in the AI chips segment.
Notwithstanding the current challenges in raising the bar further against Nvidia, AMD seems to have the upper hand against Intel (INTC) in the data center CPU segment. Given the superior profitability profile, it's also expected to bolster AMD's margins, as the data center segment has crossed the 50% mark over the company's total revenue exposure. Therefore, it should help mitigate the margin headwinds against its nascent AI revenue business, as AMD could face pricing pressures in attempting to compete for market share in training and inference workloads.

AMD's Outlook Remains Robust



Wall Street's estimates on AMD are mixed, as analysts downgraded AMD's adjusted earnings outlook while lifting its revenue projections. Despite that, AMD's revenue and earnings profile is expected to continue improving through FY2026, corroborating management's confidence in recovering its critical business segments.
Although AMD's embedded and gaming businesses are undergoing a challenging recovery, the AI PC refresh cycle is expected to bolster its medium-term outlook. However, the segment's cyclicality and uncertain AI growth dynamics must be observed, although the segment seems to have bottomed.
Despite that, AMD's data center growth profile should remain the company's critical underpinnings in lifting buying sentiments in the stock. Hence, the opportunity for operating leverage growth should keep investors onside while awaiting more clarity on its AI revenue growth spurt through 2026.
AMD's execution against Intel has delivered solid market share growth and stock outperformance over the past five years, gaining more than 300% in total return. However, taking on Nvidia's AI leadership has proved more challenging than anticipated, suggesting volatility in AMD could persist.

Is AMD Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?



Notwithstanding my optimism, investors must acknowledge that the market has bet on the NVDA horse over AMD's since NVDA/AMD bottomed out in late 2022. Hence, AMD has not convinced the market (yet) that it has the necessary product and system leadership to challenge Nvidia.
I believe the uptrend bias in NVDA/AMD is not expected to reverse unless Lisa Su and her team deliver a more convincing AI revenue outlook by 2025. Hence, investors have likely lowered their confidence in a resounding outlook at AMD's Q4 release and guidance, as Nvidia is expected to ramp up the shipment of Blackwell AI chips through 2025. Moreover, the annualized product launch cadence could lower the technological breakthroughs for AMD's AI chips, helping Nvidia maintain its grip through its full-stack approach.
In addition, there's an increasing possibility that the leading AI companies and hyperscalers could turn to their custom chips moving ahead. The revelation by Amazon (AMZN) that its ""largest data center customers are using its Graviton chips"" could impact the growth profile of AMD's data center segment. In addition, OpenAI is reportedly working with Broadcom (AVGO) on custom AI chips, corroborating an ongoing trend to diversify their reliance on merchant chips. Given AMD's developing opportunity in the AI revenue segment, it could impact the long-term accuracy of its TAM in merchant AI chips, which is worsened by Nvidia's ability to maintain ecosystem incumbency.


AMD's forward adjusted PEG ratio of 1.05 is more than 40% below its tech sector (XLK) median. Hence, given the underlying challenges enunciated above, investors seemed to have de-rated its growth prospects.
There's little doubt that AMD is still priced for growth (""A"" growth grade). Hence, investors must anticipate potential volatility that could challenge their principal growth vectors in the data center segment (CPUs and GPUs). Notwithstanding my caution, I've not yet assessed a bearish reversal in AMD buying sentiments, suggesting a dip-buying opportunity could be close.


As seen above, AMD's price action suggests it remains in an uptrend bias. Its ""C+"" buying momentum corroborates my observation that investors have not given up on the AI dark horse's stock.
Also, given the steep decline over the past two weeks, I assess that AMD could bottom above its recent September 2024 lows. Although a bullish reversal has not been observed, I'm confident in AMD's burgeoning data center AI chips opportunity and the growth inflection in its profitability margins as it scales its data center segment.
Moreover, its PEG ratio seems significantly undervalued, suggesting substantial execution risks have likely been reflected in its bullish thesis.

 -  Stellantis has had a rough year with falling sales, revenues and profitability characterising the latest Q3 results.
 -  Poor management of their U.S. brands resulted in a mismatch between the consumer demand and production mixes with an excessive number of high-end cars being produced.
 -  Underlying business economics are superb at Stellantis with the firm being the only legacy automaker with a real net-cash position.
 -  Shares could be undervalued by up to 76% although future FCF depends on a revitalised set of brands and vehicles.
 -  Buy rating issued.


Investment Thesis

Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) is the automaker behind some iconic brands such as Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat and Citroën.
Despite the firm's massive scale and global reach, a mismatch between what consumers want and the cars sold by Stellantis has resulted in a significant reduction in revenues and sales.
Third-quarter results saw this phenomenon continue to plague Stellantis although the firm has been able to clear some U.S. inventories through promotions and price reductions.
While the European business is doing quite well, the U.S. brands are in need of a revitalisation both in their reputations and in the portfolio of cars being sold under these badges.
According to my DCF calculation, shares trade at a massive 76% undervaluation.
Still, it is important to consider the impact a slower than expected turnaround may have on future cashflows as well as how a recessionary environment may drag on earnings.
I rate STLA a Buy at present time and believe a cyclical deep-value opportunity exists in shares.

Business Overview

Stellantis is the fourth-largest automaker in the world and the company behind many well-known brands such as Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Fiat, Citroën, Peugeot, Opel and even Maserati. Settling in just behind Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai Group, Stellantis has massive scale with the firm managing their operations across 130 countries from their headquarters in the Netherlands.
The company itself is the culmination of multiple mergers over the last few decades with the most notable being the 2021 combination of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and French Peugeot S.A.
Europe accounts for approximately 40% of combined sales and is now Stellantis’ largest market according to this metric. The North American segment is slightly smaller accounting for about 35% of sales although it does bring in 50% of all revenues.
When comparing Stellantis against rivals such as General Motors (GM), Ford (F) or even Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) in Europe, the geographic reach held by the automaker stands out against its competitors.
Thanks to leading brand names in the North American, European and Asian markets, Stellantis has a unique opportunity to drive sales across essentially every single automotive marketplace on earth.
CEO Carlos Tavares has lead operations at the company since the formation of Stellantis with Tavares overseeing both the automakers blockbuster FY23 as well as the total collapse witnessed in the current FY24.
Tavares may have allowed mistakes to happen in the management of the U.S. business and brands which has brought the firm to what appears to be a new nadir post-2008 financial crisis.
At the core of Stellantis’ recent struggles has been a softening consumer demand environment exacerbating the mismatch between the preferred product mix by consumers and the production mix of cars by the automaker.
This mismatch between consumer demands and production has been particularly exacerbated in the U.S. market.

Economic Moat - In Depth Analysis

Stellantis is a legacy automaker through-and-through and has no economic moat in my opinion.


Their core brands, Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Citroën, Peugeot, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Opel are all well-known monikers within the automotive industry.
While many of these brands are particularly influential in different markets across the globe (Fiat in Italy, Dodge in the U.S. and Peugeot and Citroën in France), I do not believe that any of these badges generate moatiness.
In order to create moatiness for the firm, these brands would have to produce outsized pricing power. Unfortunately for Stellantis, essentially all of their brands apart from Maserati fall into the mass-market segment which is highly price competitive.
Despite certain offerings from the likes of Dodge, Chrysler and Alfa Romeo certainly being up-market products, even these brands lack the prestige and reputation of competitors such as BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:MBGYY) or even Volkswagen’s Audi.
As a result, I believe Stellantis is a price-taker with the firm’s vehicle sales relying on a competitive pricing position within the market.
When considering the automotive industry as a whole, firms are faced with a hugely competitive and capital-intensive landscape resulting in thin margins and an average ROIC of just 5.19%.
Stellantis has been unable to buck these industry means with five-year average gross margins of just 19.60%. This relatively curtailed gross margin supports my earlier hypothesis that Stellantis as a conglomerate of automotive brands lacks a material collective pricing power.
Nevertheless, their ROIC of 9.71% is slightly above their current estimated WACC of 7.94% which is very positive as it illustrates that Stellantis is able to create value by growing operations.
Considering Stellantis’ pretty superb ROA of 6.43% and a ROCE of 16.79%, I would not critique a fellow investor for suggesting that the firm holds a clear cost advantage when it comes to producing their automobiles.
Unfortunately, I do not believe this to be the case. The outsized returns on invested capital have arisen due to the company reducing investment into their business.
While this limited investment helps boost their current returns, Stellantis’ brands and vehicles have been steadily losing market share both in the U.S. and Europe suggesting customers see other competing products as more suitable and desirable.


Stellantis hopes their commitment to producing high-quality EVs and hybrids will regain lost market share as other legacy automakers struggle to switch to BEV production. The EU’s 45.3% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles should help support Stellantis in these endeavours.
Considering the long-term I think the only avenue for Stellantis to follow is to create a more distinct price and prestige ladder for their 14 brands.
By moving a few brands further up-market while still maintaining a strong presence in the mass-market segment, Stellantis will be able to reduce competition between their own brands (something particularly present in Europe with Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat and Opel all competing in the same price category) and importantly obtain lasting pricing-power through their higher-end cars.
The investment required for these developments to be achieved will most likely reduce the firm’s returns in the short-term but should allow Stellantis to regain market share thus positioning themselves better for long-term success.
The overall successful management of icons such as Dodge and Jeep is also a priority for Stellantis considering the massive fan following and reputation these brands have in the North American market.
I fail to understand the motive in axing the Challenger as well as the dereliction of the Chrysler badge.
While Stellantis may have a method supporting these decisions, they are difficult to understand from the perspective of both a consumer and a businessman.

Fiscal Analysis

Compared to most debt-laden automakers, Stellantis is (perhaps surprisingly to some) in a pretty solid financial position.
Nevertheless, I want to start my discussion from their most recent Q3 FY24 results which were certainly a mixed bag.


Net revenues declined 27% YoY to just €33.0 billion. This decrease came due to a 20% YoY slowdown in shipments of just 1,148 thousand cars and a slight reduction in the average price per vehicle sold.


While all markets witnessed a slowdown in sales, the North American segment saw a particularly significant 25% reduction in net revenues due to inventory clearing taking precedent over the sale of newly produced vehicles.
Weakness in sales amongst the Jeep, Dodge and RAM brands came as expensive and high-end models produced in 2023 have struggled to sell as customers demand more affordable cars instead. This is the fundamental disconnect I mentioned earlier between the production and consumption mixes.
Stellantis’ only luxury brand Maserati sold just 8,600 cars in Q3, a 60% decline YoY which once again illustrates the weakness in their more expensive portfolio of cars.
Conversely, the Citroën, Fiat and Peugeot brands all saw relatively solid sales with just slight annual declines occurring primarily as a result of a decreased propensity for consumption amongst consumers.
I consider the firm’s European brands to be in the strongest position both reputationally and from a market share perspective thanks to their strategy of producing high-tech yet affordable cars.


Nevertheless, the weakness in sales that has persisted throughout FY24 left Stellantis’ half-year FY24 operating income down approximately 30% YoY at just $6.64 billion.
It must still be noted that Stellantis remains a profitable enterprise and continues to enjoy a present-day operating margin of approximately 7.88%.


Seeking Alpha’s Quant rates STLA as having an “A+” profitability grade. Considering the firm’s current profitability and ability as an automaker to out-earn their own cost of capital, I am largely inclined to agree with this rating.
Nevertheless, it is important to consider the slow sales affecting Stellantis as the automaker tackles their ambitious catalogue overhaul.
When I first started analysing the balance sheet at Stellantis I almost couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The company is perhaps one of the most well capitalised automakers in the world.
With over $40.8 billion in total cash and equivalents, total assets worth $221.7 billion and total liabilities of just $133.5 billion, Stellantis is on solid economic underpinnings with a material net cash position. All other major automakers (at least in the U.S. and Europe) hold net-debt positions.
Short-term liquidity is also solid at Stellantis with the firm having a current ratio of 1.14x thanks to their significant cash reserves and sustainable current liabilities of $81.4 billion.
Long-term debt has also been effectively managed with the automaker holding $21.4 billion on their balance sheets. Most of these debentures are at fixed coupon rates with an average interest rate of around 3.2%.
Furthermore, the majority of debentures are not due until after 2026 which gives Stellantis breathing room before significant repayments are due.


Analysis of cash-flows presents a slightly more disappointing situation with the HY24 cash from operating falling a whopping 65% YoY to just €4.9 billion. This massive drop (combined with a 28% increase in CAPEX to fund EV and brand investments) left industrial FCF at negative €392 million.
I am not too concerned with these FCF declines as the significant overhaul of products and transition to an EV-centred portfolio of vehicles requires increased capital expenditure to be completed.
The long-term benefits of more shared vehicle architectures and an industry leading position in technology integrations should benefit all of Stellantis’ brands significantly.
In turn, I suspect these investments will reduce ROA, ROE and ROIC closer to the automotive industry’s average figures.
Overall, I must admit that I do not see Stellantis as being in a particularly concerning financial position. Their underlying economics are wonderful with a net-cash position separating the business from essentially all their competitors.
What I believe is required to revitalise the business is the successful execution of their portfolio overhaul and an increased level of CAPEX into their brands and technologies. This should allow Stellantis brands to regain market share thus increasing revenues, cash flows and pricing power for the firm.

Valuation

Seeking Alpha’s Quant provides STLA with an “A+” valuation rating at present time. Considering the fairly-valued nature of most markets today, the suggested undervaluation in Stellantis’ stock is certainly enticing for a value-oriented investor.


STLA is trading cheap according to essentially every valuation metric. The P/E GAAP TTM of 2.83x is massively below rivals Ford (11.72x) and GM (5.49x) while their P/B TTM of 0.46x is also around 25% below that of rivals.
Stellantis’ P/S TTM ratio is also very depressed at just 0.23x. To highlight this further, STLA stock is trading at less than 75% of the value of sales in the TTM.
Considering these metrics it appears as though Mr. Market may be in the midst of an irrational pricing event.


Looking at Seeking Alpha’s Advanced Chart, I can only say that the TTM for STLA stock has been quite brutal with the automaker’s stock plummeting over 53% from highs in early April, 2024.
Investors appear to have lost their patience with STLA as a result of the weaker than anticipated earnings. The popular S&P500 tracking SPY (SPY) index fund has massively outperformed STLA stock to the tune of almost 60% on a TTM basis.
I also produced a DCF calculation for STLA stock so as to gain a quantitative intrinsic value figure for shares.


All input data including FCF and the balance sheet items for STLA were sourced from Seeking Alpha’s Financials tab in USD. I adjusted the elevated 20% annualised growth rate to 2.5% for the projected growth rate to account for the outsized impact the FCA-PSA merger had on results as I don’t forecast Stellantis to complete any additional mergers.
I used a 2.63% terminal growth rate as I do not expect Stellantis to significantly outperform the greater U.S. and European markets due to the cyclical and capital-intensive nature of the automotive sector. I chose the 93-year average S&P500 annualised return of 7.98% as my discount rate.
I calculated an IV for STLA of $57.47 suggesting a massive 76% undervaluation in shares based upon the present value of all future cashflows from today to judgement day.
However, I want to preface my calculation with the reality that automotive sector companies generally trade at around a 10-20% discount relative to IV during peaks of the economic cycle.
I believe investors are applying a cyclicality penalty to their valuations hence the relative cheapness of shares even at their peaks.
By applying a similar 20% discount to my IV figure, I obtain a valuation for STLA of $45.90 per share.
Considering my outlook for Stellantis stock, I believe significant volatility is in store at least in the short-term (1-12 months). The election cycle in the U.S. combined with a very soft European economic environment makes it difficult to predict car sales trends.
My long-term (1-10 year) outlook for STLA revolves around the company producing a competitive set of automotive products and around moving one or two brands further upmarket to differentiate them in an otherwise homogenous market.
Should Stellantis achieve these goals, I believe they would be well positioned to benefit from rapidly growing Asian economies and a recovering U.S. market.

Stellantis Risk Profile

As an automotive manufacturer, Stellantis is exposed to two key risks: market cyclicality and competitive pressures.
Automobiles tend to be an expensive purchase for most consumers with the effect being even more acute for purchasers of new cars. While times of economic prosperity and low interest rates can fuel new car sales, economic downturns and even periods of slower growth can result in significantly reduced demand.
Due to this macroeconomic relationship, Stellantis’ revenues are ultimately at the mercy of the economic cycles prevailing across the global economy.
Massive levels of competition (particularly now from Chinese EV manufacturers) also creates risk. The current year has served as proof that if Stellantis is unable to satisfy consumer demands, sales will suffer significantly as customers face essentially zero switching costs and simply buy competing products instead.
Stellantis cannot afford to have a prolonged period where the production and demand mixes do not align. I do believe their new portfolio overhaul has the potential to solve this issue so long as the firm executes on their strategy effectively.
I’d also like to quickly highlight the threat safety and reliability issues can have for Stellantis. While many of their brands (such as Fiat, Jeep and Citroën) do not have any material reputations for being unsafe, they do harbour a certain aura of unreliability.
Many consumer quality reports highlight poor reliability in Stellantis cars. While newer Stellantis shared-platform vehicles appear to be more reliable than the old Fiat-Chrysler era designs, the threat exists that consumers hesitate to buy their cars due to reliability concerns.
This could cause real damage to the existing brands negating any ability for Stellantis to effectively develop them further.
The threat of a real and acute safety issue could also cause damage to Stellantis’ already challenged reputation.

Summary

Stellantis is most certainly battling through a difficult period. Changing environmental standards, customer preferences and increased levels of competition have hit the automaker on multiple fronts.
I like Stellantis’ economics, capital allocation structure and general approach to cost effectiveness.
Nevertheless, I continue to be cautious about the turnaround currently in progress at the automaker. Strength in European and some Asian markets does not necessarily mean that Stellantis is equipped to manage the U.S. business.
GM’s ill-fated early 2000s expansion into Europe comes to mind as an example of a firm successful in one region struggling to survive in another. Conversely, Ford has managed to create a successful global automotive business which targets each market differently yet effectively.
My overall outlook hinges on the company recreating the highly successful portfolio of brands that propelled it through the mid to late 2010s. Should the current brand overhaul work as intended, I believe Stellantis could start regaining marketshare and volumes.
Regardless, the current valuation is cheap. Both metrics and my DCF suggest massive value is present even when considering a historic, industry-wide undervaluation that tends to accompany shares.
I rate Stellantis a Buy at present time as I believe that the overall valuation is simply too cheap for a firm facing no real financial risk. The automaker strikes me as a deep-value play which could allow for outsized gains to be made during the next economic up-cycle.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732432-brookdale-senior-living-upcoming-q3-earnings-report-may-confirm-bearish-trend,4732432,Brookdale Senior Living: Upcoming Q3 Earnings Report May Confirm Bearish Trend,"Summary

 -  Brookdale Senior is announcing its Q3 earnings numbers for fiscal 2024 on the 6th of November after the close.
 -  Considering the company's negative earnings profile and high debt, investors need to see a clear line of sight to strong forward-looking growth.
 -  The stock is presenty in an intermediate downtrend so the 'probable' earnings result is for the trend to continue.


Intro

We wrote about Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:BKD) in May of this year, pointing out how the company's high debt and elevated short interest would likely cap the stock's upside. Overhead resistance on the technical chart was another impediment that stood in the way of the stock making further gains. As we see below, shares topped out in late July this year with the company's subsequent Q2 earnings miss (announced on the 8th of August) unable to do anything to stop the decline. Furthermore, Brookdale's 10-week moving average has now crossed beneath its 40-week counterpart; registering a potential death cross which could lead to more declines over the forthcoming weeks. Therefore, although shares of Brookdale rose to almost $8 a share in July of this year, the stock is still down approximately 8% since our May commentary with grave concerns that the pattern of lower of lows will continue over the near term.
Our concerns on the intermediate chart also make themselves known on the short-term chart. As we see below, not only do we have an abbreviation of a potential head & shoulders top but shares in August this year broke below a multi-year bullish trend-line dating back to March'2023. This (at least over the near-term) most likely illustrates a 'change in trend' which is why investors looking to buy into this latest down move need to be careful.
What could stop the carnage since late July is Brookdale's upcoming Q3 earning report which is expected to be released next Wednesday (6th of November) after market close. The GAAP estimate is -$0.18 per share on revenues of $784.23 million. Over the past three months, EPS estimates have seen 2 downward revisions & 0 upward revisions. On the revenue side over the same timeframe, 3 downward revisions were recorded compared to 0 upward revisions. Remember, how revisions fare out is important as investors tend to look at associated trends to decipher the forward-looking growth potential of the company in question.

Negative Earnings Continue

Management in its most recent reported earnings release (Q2 on 8/8/2024) reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% & adjusted free-cash-flow growth of 26%. Followers of our work will understand our disdain for working off EBITDA numbers when doing due diligence. EBITDA (Or their adjusted equivalents) does not take into account capital expenditure which means it gives a distorted view of a company's profitability.
To see another view of the income statement, it is recommended to consult the cash-flow statement as here we get a clear picture of how cash entered & exited Brookdale's coffers over a specified period.
Operating cash flow of $55.7 million in Q2 this year came in 12%+ lower compared to the same period of 12 months prior ($63.8 million). Given Brookdale's capital expenditure of $51.6 million in the quarter, the company did manage to eke out a positive free cash flow of $4.1 million in Q2 this year. Although free-cash-flow generation has been in deep negative territory over the past 12 months (-$89.8 million), management continues to talk up Brookdale's present growth trends (Occupancy growth, RevPar growth, operating margin growth, etc).
Just remember the following. When there are so many moving parts in a company (such as the occupancy rate of Brookdale's residents, associate retention rate, margins, HealthPlus, adjusted profit numbers, etc), it is easy for management on earnings calls to cherry-pick some metrics and focus their coverage on these areas. However, when it boils down to it, here is where Brookdale's valuation stands after the company's Q2 earnings results in fiscal 2024.
As we see above, Brookdale's negative earnings plus its overextended debt-to-equity ratio of 9.91 means strong growth is the ONLY way to produce sustained share-price gains. Due to negative earnings, capital continues to get siphoned out of Brookdale's coffers every quarter. Although Brookdale bulls may point to the attractiveness of the company's sales compared to the sector, we can not stress the importance of how sustained negative earnings tend to affect a company's growth path over time.
Suffice it to say, that considering Brookdale's financial predicament, growth remains the number one priority for the company, bar none. To this point, we do not believe the CEO's recent comments that Brookdale will be able to deliver a strong value proposition to residents, associates & shareholders as the company stands today. Evidence of this a few years ago is how residents were swiftly moved on to make room for higher-paying Medicare-covered guests.
Apart from organic gains, the CEO also pointed to the aging US population (favorable demographics) as well as record lows in the construction of inventory as trends that will spike demand for Brookdale's services going forward. This reasoning is too general as firstly, most services tend to suffer amid an economic contraction (as Brookdale did in the great recession of 2008-2009 as well as in 2020) irrespective of the availability of inventory. Secondly, regarding demographics, prolonged inflation is a concern on the pricing side in that Brookdale's low EBIT margins do not offer much scope to be able to withstand higher costs.

Conclusion

To sum up, Brookdale Senior is announcing its Q3 earnings numbers on the 6th of November after the close. An unconvincing report coupled with a sales & earnings miss may confirm the death-cross evident on the intermediate chart. This may be our cue to sell the stock. We look forward to continued coverage.

 -  You can collect income from millions of homeowners across the U.S. without ever leaving your home.
 -  Passive income means fewer stressors and more enjoyment.
 -  What is the true American dream?
 -  I am Rida Morwa. I have been advising individual and institutional clients on high yield investment strategies since 1991. I lead the investing group High Dividend Opportunities.


Co-authored by Treading Softly.
When you consider the American dream, what does that mean for you?
The concept of the American dream has been with us since the Great Depression. It's been used and abused, defined and redefined multiple times. For many people, the American dream is summed up as a white picket fence around a house. It is the ability to own a home and have a wage that allows you to live a comfortable life from 40 hours of work, and the possibility that anyone can achieve that in America. Yet when the concept of the American dream began, it wasn't about consumerism or materialism. Quite the opposite, actually. James Truslow Adams, who is credited for popularizing the term, defined it this way:
So, while the dream of homeownership is one that many of us share, it is not essential to be part of achieving the American dream. The concept revolves around the fact that anyone can start from any starting point and, by virtue of their character, work ethic, and what they're able to achieve, can climb higher. We've seen entrepreneurs of all stripes who come to America from other lands and achieve great success because of their skills, abilities, and tenacity. You don't have to look far to discover that those individuals are embodying what is believed to be the American dream. Yet, homeownership is still the dream of many, and for good reason. Owning a home can provide you with many intangible benefits outside building equity and developing wealth.
Today, I want to look at a route in which you can benefit from the homeownership of others. The last time we covered this company, we concluded:
The big question is, how has AGNC done in continuing to use the premium to their book value that they trade for to their benefit or have they squandered that benefit so far? Today, I want to take a look at the most recent quarterly earnings and see if there are any insights we can glean as we continue to collect great income for our neighbors.
Let's dive in!

How's My Neighborly Income Stream?

AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) is a mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) that focuses on buying agency mortgage-backed securities (agency MBS). When adding leverage, it provides massive income to shareholders, with yields of 15.5%.
AGNC reported earnings that fell in line with our expectations. Book value was up 5% for the quarter as MBS prices recovered. AGNC continues to trade at a material premium to book value, and it is worth noting that book value is down so far in October. We look at book value, but it is important to remember that it changes every single day, and the book value we see is just one day in a quarter. Source.


MBS prices have stabilized. While they vary, they have been trading in a tighter range than they were during the Fed's hiking cycle. We can see that looking at the chart for 5.5% coupon MBS over the past 5 years: Source.


MBS prices are nowhere close to a full recovery, but have stopped their decline and have been much more stable.
AGNC's Net Spread & Dollar Roll Income declined significantly in Q3 to $0.43. Still easily covering the dividend, but on a downward trend:


As we explained last quarter, this was expected because AGNC had several very low-paying interest rate swaps that were maturing in Q3. AGNC had inflated earnings thanks to those swaps, and those weren't sustainable. That's why AGNC didn't raise its dividend to match earnings, they knew the swaps would roll off.
Last quarter, we presented this slide to you, showing the swaps that were rolling off. Note $10.5 billion in swaps paying just 0.1% were maturing in an average of 0.4 years. A large chunk of those rolled off this quarter.


Looking at the same slide from Q3, we can note that the average maturity for the next batch is 0.8 years.


So the big decline in Q3 was expected, and now AGNC has a period where it won't see significant swaps expiring for another 6 months. So for the next two quarters, we can expect their cash flow to increase. Unless the Fed slashes rates to 0% in the next 6 months, odds are that repo rates will be higher than 0.13% so in Q2 2025 we can expect another increase in interest expense. However, it will be smaller than we saw last quarter.
Meanwhile, AGNC issued equity in Q3 taking advantage of their premium to book value and buying more agency MBS.


AGNC increased its MBS holdings by $8.3 billion in Q3, and its portfolio is larger than it has been in several years. AGNC's average asset yield continues to climb upward:


The pace of growth is slowing as the portfolio is approaching the coupon of new MBS (5.5%). This will continue to climb, albeit at a slower pace. This will set them up in a very positive position for when the cost of borrowing comes down further.
Without hedges, AGNC's cost of repurchase agreements was 5.26% in Q3, that number will decline quickly in relation to the Fed's target rate as the average maturity is 14 days. Declining rates will benefit the unhedged portion of AGNC's portfolio, which for the past two years, AGNC has hedged more than 100% of its debt. In Q2 it was hedging 98% and in Q3 it is hedging 72%:


This decline in hedge ratio is because AGNC anticipates the Fed will keep cutting, and it will allow their portfolio to benefit from lower rates. A 72% hedge ratio tells us that 28% of AGNC's debt will decline in cost whenever the Fed cuts rates.
In the earnings call, management said they expect the long-term economics to be a ROE (return on equity) of 16-18%, which is where they expect their net spread income to end up as the moving parts normalize. Here is an excerpt from the call:
This is consistent with the current dividend, and possibly a dividend increase. We saw an increase from peer Dynex Capital (DX) this quarter. DX was more conservative with the payout ratio to begin with. However, we believe that the dynamics are improving for the whole sector and DX's raise was the first of several we will see throughout the sector going into 2025. A steepening yield curve is a massive benefit for these companies, and the negative headwinds are being relieved every time the Fed cuts.
Agency MBS remains a sector we are extremely bullish on.

Conclusion

With AGNC, we can continue to collect wonderful monthly income while the mREIT leverages its unique position to grow its portfolio and, by extension, our exposure to the homeownership of millions of Americans. Looking forward, agency MBS remains attractively priced, and falling rates benefit AGNC over time as their old hedging continues to fall off.
When it comes to retirement, I like to encourage my readers to dream big. A big retirement dream isn't defined in dollars and cents; it's defined in goals you want to achieve during retirement, places you wish to visit, or the lifestyle you would like to live. Money is a tool, not an endpoint. It enables you to live life more effortlessly but makes a miserable life when it forms the sole focus. Enrich your life with experiences and relationships, and allow money to support you. A lack of money can lead to massive issues in retirement; a surplus of money has limited benefits. My Income Method is designed to be a tool you use to achieve your dreams, not the dream itself. Your dream should be as beautiful and unique as you are.
That's the beauty of my Income Method. That's the beauty of income investing.
Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of AGNC either through stock ownership, options, or other derivatives. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732398-ani-pharmaceuticals-is-acting-like-it-is-being-acquired-anip-stock,4732398,ANI Pharmaceuticals Is Acting Like It Is Being Acquired,"Summary

 -  Several actions or omissions by ANIP is consistent with them being acquired and being restricted in what they can disclose.
 -  Offer could exceed $8 billion plus sales based CVRs.
 -  Offer likely contingent on FDA approval of NDA filed in Q3 2023 for undisclosed drug filed by ANIP but application appears to be financed by undisclosed partner.


In 'ANI Pharmaceuticals: Tezruly Just Approved, 2 More NDAs Under Review And Alimera Science Acquisition Could Triple Revenue By 2028', I explained how ANIP’s revenue could grow to $1.41 billion in sales and $290 million in royalties by 2028, with significant continued growth potential. Since the article was published on August 2, 2024, ANIP has acted like a company in the process of being acquired. The following is a list of indicators pointing to likelihood of ANIP being acquired by a larger pharmaceutical company. It is difficult to assess what the offer will be, or when it will be announced, but it should be in multiples of current PPS. The following will lay out indicators consistent with ANIP being acquired in a deal that could near $8 billion upfront and sales based contingent value rights exceeding $4 billion.
ANIP obtained a certification (used when filing NDA) to delay posting results of largest female testosterone trial.
Certification to delay posting results are issued when a New Drug Application is being submitted to the FDA. On October 27, 2021, ANIP submitted a Certification request to delay posting results of their long-term safety and efficacy study involving 3,656 participants administering testosterone to postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) who are at a higher risk of having a cardiovascular (CV) events. The primary end point of BioSante Pharmaceuticals' (now ANIP) LibiGel Safety Study is a composite of CV events including death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, hospitalized unstable angina, and venous thromboembolic events. Breast cancer was a coprimary end point, but appears to have becomes a secondary endpoint following the review of the first 4,000 patient years of data, where they discovered that restoring testosterone reduced cardiovascular events by at least 70%. In 2015, they discovered that it reduced breast cancer by an undisclosed amount.
In ANI Pharmaceuticals Is Undervalued, As Royalty Potential Is Overlooked, I go in to greater detail regarding ANIP’s female testosterone product. The results were due to be posted by October 27, 2023. ANIP appears to be in non-compliance for posting results of the clinical trial.
Note: To date, ANIP has yet to announce that an NDA has been filed or that they intend to file an NDA for female testosterone consistent with their certification request to delay submitting results. Results must be submitted within 30 days of an FDA approval.
ANIP has an Undisclosed Partner funding a pending NDA, most likely for the First Female Testosterone Drug.
In ANIP's Q3 2023 press release, they announced that it had submitted two NDAs but did not provide any information on the drugs. Buried in the related 10-Q filing, it shows that ANIP only paid one of the NDA submission fees. To date, subsequent filings do not show that ANIP paid the second NDA submission fee from these NDA submissions. If the NDA relates to female testosterone, the fee would have been $3.2 million. No details have been provided regarding the drug or the indications listed in their filings and no PDUFA date was ever provided by ANIP.
Note: Requests to ANIP for additional information on these filings, including the NDA's active ingredient (e.g. testosterone), indications and PDUFA date have all gone unanswered.
In Q1 2024, ANIP filed an NDA but does not publicly announce it.
In Q1 2024, ANIP submitted a third NDA but did not even make an announcement in their earnings press release, as they did in Q3 2023. The information is buried in the related 10-Q filing. To date ANIP has not responded request for details regarding this NDA either, though I believe it to be related to an oral liquid form of hydrochlorothiazide for which Novitium received a patent, which expires December 9, 2041
ANIP discontinued NDA marketing authorization for Tezruly within two months of approval, yet submitted patent protection documentation expiring in 2042.
On July 29, 2024, the FDA approved of Tezruly (oral solution for terazosin), as I understand it, this is the first regulatory approval for an oral solution of an alpha-1 blocker in the world. Marketing authorization for the drug was granted on August 1, 2024 to Novitium Pharma, an ANIP subsidiary. ANIP has yet to announce the approval or the discontinuation, nor receipt of the patent related to Tezruly. Currently the Orange Book shows that on September 24, 2024, Novitium Pharmaceuticals, submitted patent protection information in their NDA expiring January 18, 2042. According to ""Marketing Status Notifications Under Section 506I of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; Content and Format - Guidance for Industry"", the FDA discontinues marketing status for drugs not available for sale within 180 days of drug approval. Therefore it is likely the acquiring company will launch Tezruly. The following is from the Orange Book website.
Note: The delay in launching Tezruly, negatively affects Muthusamy ""Samy"" Shanmugan, ANIP's Head of R&D and COO of their NJ Operations, and Chad Gassert, ANIP's Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy, who, according to SEC filings, in selling Novitium Pharma to ANIP, are entitled to $21.5 million in earn-out payments at 20% of the net profits related to Tezruly and most likely the NDA filed in Q1 2024.
ANIP Receives Patent Protection for Purified Cortrophin Gel until 2043, yet does not announce it.
On May 17, 2024, and October 4, 2024, ANIP submitted the following patent data related to Purified Cortrophin Gel to the FDA but has yet to inform investors of such. This extends the long-term prospects for continued growth of Cortrophin sales, which the market has yet to take into consideration.
ANIP Acquisition Company, doing business as ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., currently has few shares remaining for future business development.
In July 2013, 2013, ANIP, a company which had yet to post a profit, executed a 1:6 reverse stock split. In doing so they also reduced authorized shares from 200 million to 33.33 million shares. According to their 2013 Q2 10-Q filing, ANIP reported having ""33,333,334 shares authorized; 9,536,079 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2013"". Now, ANIP authorized shares are almost all spoken for, potentially limiting future business development. According to ANIP’s 2024 Q2 10-Q filing they reported having 21,030,069 outstanding shares. In their S-8 filed July 12, 2024, ANIP reported in their Amended and Restated 2022 Stock Incentive Plan that “the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock registered to be issued or transferred under the Plan is now capped at 6,510,000 shares of the company’s stock.” The $316.25 million senior convertible note offering sets aside a maximum of 5,547,246 shares of the Company’s common stock may be issued upon conversion of the notes. This leaves ANIP with 246,019 shares for future business development without changes to the S-8 and or the convertible notes.
The fact ANIP did not keep 200 million authorized shares in their 2013 reverse stock split, points to the possibility that ANIP intended to be bought out at some point in the future. It appears that time may be approaching and may be linked to the partnered NDA.
ANIP now have a Corporate and a Commercial Headquarters both located in the United States.
ANIP’s website now list that they have a Commercial Headquarters located in Princeton, NJ, while maintaining their Corporate Headquarters in Baudette, MN According to ANIP's locations webpage they list two facilities in Baudette the corporate headquarters and a containment facility. However, in ANIP's frequently asked questions page it indicates that it only has two manufacturing facilities in the US, which is consistent with their Linkedin page. This suggest that they intend to dispose of their containment facility located in Baudette, MN, which could become redundant, if ANIP was being acquired.
Note: In the United States, most commercial headquarters appear to be set up by foreign ownership, which could include foreign subsidiaries of US based companies.
Potential Deal Valuation
It is difficult to assess the value of a deal for ANIP. However, the following proposes potential valuations. ANIP's current Market Cap sits at $1.14 billion. Since, much of the above information has not been shared with investors, ANIP appears significantly undervalued. A deal should more accurately reflect multiples of estimated peak sales for the following:
- Fair value might be $2 billion
- Fair value might be $500 million
- Fair value might be $500, if approved
- ANIP just acquired for $381 million in upfront consideration.
- Fair value might be assessed at $750 million.
Excluding CG Oncology Royalties, ANIP could be looking at over $4 billion for the above listed assets.
Finally, you have the NDA filed in Q3 2023 by ANIP, where the regulatory process appears to be funded by another pharmaceutical company.
- Based on $2 billion in peak sales for treating HSDD, fair value could be assessed at $4 billion, plus sales based CVRs in excess of $4 billion.
Arguably you are looking at a deal that could exceed $8 billion in upfront considerations plus CVRs.
Risks
The theory that ANIP is being bought out is speculative and until ANIP confirms otherwise should be treated as such. With the limited amount of information provided by ANIP, the valuations regarding a buyout is also speculative. Though ANIP's actions of holding back information is factual. ANIP does not provide a pipeline of drugs under development to assist investor in making a fair valuation. The partnered NDA may not be for female testosterone, though ANIP did submit a certification request to delay submitting results for their female testosterone studies. The partnered NDA and or the NDA filed in Q1 2024 may not receive FDA approval.
In the event of buyout, it is unknown how many share will be outstanding upon closing of the deal.
Conclusion
ANIP is currently undervalued when considering their approved and unadvertised pipeline of drugs. ANIP appears restricted from sharing advancements of its pipeline which is consistent with condition of an acquisition agreement. These restrictions appear to prevent ANIP from announcing:
Additionally, the following actions further the possibility that ANIP is being acquired.
I expect that acquisition offer will be fair, maybe not the most ANIP could receive, but fair. The deal estimated at $8 Billion plus CVRs is based on accumulated information and not info that ANIP publicly announced, as stated is speculative and should be treated as such.

 -  Crocs has been oversold at current levels, as the market over-reacts to the softer FQ4'24 guidance and the stock tanking by -21% over two days.
 -  If anything, HEYDUDE has shown sequential sales growth since FQ1'24, with FY2025 likely to bring forth an easier YoY comparison.
 -  We also believe that the domestic demand headwinds may be well balanced by the double digit growths observed in the international region, with the pain likely to be temporal.
 -  CROX is likely to outperform from these oversold levels, offering opportunistic investors with a rich capital appreciation prospect.
 -  Even so, investors may want to temper their near-term expectations, since sentiments are likely to remain pessimistic until a successful reversal has been observed.


CROX's Long-Term Investment Thesis Remains Robust - Albeit With Numerous Near-Term Headwinds

We previously covered Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) in August 2024, discussing the market's mixed reactions to the lackluster HEYDUDE FQ2'24 performance, despite the excellent core CROCS outperformance.
With the management already raising their FY2024 guidance and HEYDUDE generating sequential improvements in sales numbers, we had believed that it remained well positioned to report robust numbers in H2'24, significantly aided by the rich FCF generation and improving balance sheet health.



CROX YTD Stock Price
Since then, CROX has mostly traded sideways before the market painfully over-reacted to the softer FQ4'24 guidance, despite the double beat FQ3'24 performance.
We believe that the -21% sell-off has been overly done indeed, attributed to the notable sequential improvement in HEYDUDE's numbers, significantly aided by the still decent CROCS execution.
For reference, HEYDUDE has seen sales bottoming at $195M in FQ1'24 (-14.4% QoQ), with things consistently improving by +1.5% QoQ in FQ2'24 and +3% QoQ in FQ3'24. This is on top of the management's promising FQ4'24 HEYDUDE sales guidance at approximately $216.6M (-5% YoY), implying a more than decent +6.1% QoQ growth.
If anything, HEYDUDE's DTC revenues have also been increasing sequentially from $60M in FQ1'24, to $84M in FQ2'24 (+40% QoQ), and to $91M in FQ3'24 (+8.3% YoY) - with it signaling positive early indicators to its growing brand awareness.
The same was observed in HEYDUDE's higher volumes sold at 7M pairs by the latest quarter (+16.6% QoQ) and stable ASPs at $30.94 (+0.5% QoQ), contributing to the brand's improving adj gross margins of 47.9% (-1.2 points QoQ/ +5.1 YoY).
On the other hand, the CROX management's lowered FY2024 HEYDUDE sales guidance at -14.5% YoY does not instill confidence indeed, compared to the original guidance of ""flat to slightly up"" in the FQ4'23 earnings call and the lowered number to -9% YoY in the FQ1'24/ FQ2'24 earnings call, attributed to the brand's painfully slow turnaround.
The same sales deceleration has also been hinted by the management for the CROCS core brand, with an estimated FQ4'24 sales guidance of $746.6M (-12.9% QoQ/ +2% YoY), compared to FQ4'23 levels of $732M (-8.3% QoQ/ +10% YoY)
It is unsurprising then, that the market has over-reacted as it has after the mixed FQ3'24 earnings call, despite CROX raising their overall FY2024 adj EPS guidance to $12.86 (+6.8% YoY), compared to the original guidance of $12.27 (+1.9% YoY) offered in the FQ4'23 earnings call.
The Consensus Forward Estimates
These reasons may also be why the consensus have decided to downgrade their forward estimates, with CROX expected to generate a decelerating top/ bottom-line growth at a CAGR of +3.5%/ +5% through FY2026.
This is compared to the original estimates of +12.09%/ +10.09% and the historical outsized growth at a CAGR of +25.3%/ +105% between FY2017 and FY2023, respectively - with it potentially implying the end of CROX's high growth trend.
CROX Valuations
This decelerating growth trend may also be why CROX has been discounted to FWD P/E non-GAAP valuations of 8.64x, compared to its 5Y pre-pandemic mean of 22.25x, 10Y mean of 25.24x, and the sector median of 17.18x.
Given the temporally dilutive impact of Heydude on its overall performance, we believe that the stock is now trading at a relatively elevated FWD PEG non-GAAP ratio of 1.90x as well, compared to its 5Y pre-pandemic mean of 0.31x and 10Y mean of 0.81x.
On the other hand, when compared to its Consumer Discretionary peers, including Nike (NKE) at FWD PEG non-GAAP ratio of 3.73x, V.F. Corporation (VFC) at 3.29x, and On Holding AG (ONON) at 2.13x, it appears that CROX remains a reasonably valued investment thesis no matter the decelerating growth trend.

So, Is CROX Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?

CROX 5Y Stock Price
For now, the market has punished CROX with an unwarranted two-day correction of -21%, as the stock now trades below its 50/ 100/ 200 day moving averages while retesting the 2024 support levels of $109s.
Based on the management's FY2024 adj EPS guidance of $12.86 (+6.8% YoY) and 1Y P/E mean of 10.20x, it is apparent that the stock is now trading below our updated fair value estimates of $131.10.
Based on the consensus downgraded FY2026 adj EPS estimates from $14.69 to $13.93, there remains an excellent upside potential of +30.2% to our updated base-case long-term price target of $142.00, thanks to the recent pullback.
If anything, we continue to stand by our previous conjecture of the potential upward rerating in its FWD P/E valuations nearer to the 5Y average of ~15x, upon the successful monetization of HEYDUDE, as discussed above, with it bringing forth a near doubling upside potential to our bull-case long-term price target of $208.90.
With FY2025 likely to bring forth an easier YoY HEYDUDE comparison as the main CROCS brand continues to grow at a projected high single digit of +8% YoY in FY2024, we believe that the CROX stock is likely to outperform from these oversold levels, offering opportunistic investors with a rich capital appreciation prospect.
Combined with the still reasonable FWD PEG non-GAAP ratio, we are reiterating our Buy rating at this dip.

Risk Warning

It goes without saying that the CROX stock is only suitable for those with a long investing trajectory, since we believe that its reversal may be prolonged, attributed to HEYDUDE's slower reversal and CROCS' decelerating sales trend in North America.
While the inflation has cooled and labor market remains robust, it is apparent that consumer discretionary spending has been impacted as consumer reverted to pre-pandemic shopping patterns dropping closer to need and concentrating spend around key shopping events and holidays, otherwise ""consumer pulling back.""
This development is critical indeed, since CROCS top-line driver remains in the North American region at 57.1% of its overall sales in FQ3'24 (-3 points YoY), with it implying more near-term pain until the macroeconomic outlook normalizes and/ or the international CROCS FQ3'24 growth at +15.4% YoY well balances the demand headwinds domestically.
As a result, CROX investors may want to remain patient, since we are unlikely to see sentiments and its stock price performance improve any time soon.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732156-googles-ai-advertising-and-autonomous-driving-capabilities-remain-dirt-cheap-reiterate-buy,4732156,"Google's AI, Advertising & Autonomous Driving Capabilities Remain Dirt Cheap - Reiterate Buy","Summary

 -  GOOG continues to offer a dirt cheap investment thesis, attributed to its well-diversified advertising/ search engine, AI/ Cloud, and autonomous driving capabilities.
 -  With the giant reporting double digit growths along with increasingly richer profit margins, we believe that the upgraded consensus estimates appear to be well justified.
 -  It also remains (somewhat) on track to achieving the $100B revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud, based on the estimated annualized sum of $96B by FQ4'24.
 -  If anything, GOOG is inherently undervalued at FWD P/E non-GAAP valuations of 21.21, compared to its Magnificent 7 peers at the P/E mean of ~44x and median of ~34x.
 -  We believe that the stock remains a long-term winner for growth oriented investors, with any upward rerating in its P/E valuations potentially triggering an even richer capital appreciation prospect.


GOOG Is Inherently Undervalued - Offering Opportunistic Investors With Rich Capital Appreciation Prospects

We previously covered Alphabet Inc. aka Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in July 2024, discussing why we had maintained our Buy rating during the ongoing market rotation then, attributed to its robust long-term prospects and accelerating search engine/ advertising/ cloud performance metrics.
Combined with the relatively cheap P/E valuations compared to its Magnificent 7/ streaming/ autonomous driving peers, it went without saying that the stock remained a long-term winner for growth oriented investors.
GOOG YTD Stock Price





Since then, GOOG has had a painful -12.8% retracement during the worst of the recent market-wide correction before rapidly recovering, with the same trend observed in its Magnificent 7 peers to varying degrees.
This development is partly aided by the +5.6% recovery after the double beat FQ3'24 performance, with the Big-Tech giant reporting revenues of $88.26B (+4.1% QoQ/ +15% YoY), increasingly rich EBIT margins of 32.3% (inline QoQ/ +4.5 YoY), and adj EPS of $2.12 (+12.1% QoQ/ +36.7% YoY).
Much of GOOG's outperformance are naturally attributed to its well-diversified capabilities across AI/ Cloud, advertising, search engine, and to a smaller extent, the autonomous capabilities, amongst others.
For one, Google Cloud has generated robust revenues of $11.35B (+9.7% QoQ/ +34.9% YoY) and expanding profit margins of 17% (+5.7 points QoQ/ +13.9 YoY) as it similarly grows its multi-year backlog to $86.8B (+10.1% QoQ/ +33.7% YoY).
If anything, GOOG remains somewhat on track to achieving its $100B revenue run-rate from both YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by end 2024, as observed in the annualized sum of $81.08B (+6.6% QoQ/ +23.8% YoY) by FQ3'24 and our estimated annualized sum of $96B by FQ4'24.
The latter is based on our estimated FQ4'24 YouTube Ads revenues of $10.6B (+19% QoQ/ +15% YoY) and Google Cloud revenues of $12.4B (+9% QoQ/ +35% YoY), based on the the two segments' double digit growth profiles on the QoQ/ YoY basis.
These numbers also build upon GOOG's growing search revenue prowess at revenues of $49.38B (+1.8% QoQ/ +12.1% YoY) along with the global leading market share at 90% as of September 2024.
Readers may also celebrate the giant's relatively unappreciated capability, Waymo/ autonomous driving, with the management already highlighting the growing paid autonomous rides to 150K on a weekly basis by October 29, 2024 (+200% QoQ) based on the 700 vehicles on the road as of August 2024.
This is an impressive feat indeed, since we are estimating 30.6 fully autonomous rides per vehicle on a daily basis (+200% QoQ), compared to UBER's (UBER) average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on the 31M daily trips in FQ3'24 and 7.4M drivers in FQ2'24.
Much of Waymo's outperformance may be attributed to GOOG's autonomous capability to run on a 24 hours, 7 days a week basis - as compared to the conventional driver-based 12 hours availability for UBER and 10 hours for regular taxis.
Even so, GOOG investors may want to temper their near-term expectations, since Waymo is unlikely to be bottom-line accretive in the intermediate term, as observed in the Other Bets' ongoing cash burn with negative operating margins of -287% (+23 points QoQ/ +115 YoY), no matter the sustained improvements thus far.
If anything, General Motor's (GM) Cruise remains unprofitable at EBIT margins of -1473% as well, as it restarted their operations in San Francisco since April 2024 - with break even likely to be prolonged.
The Consensus Forward Estimates


For now, while the GOOG management does not offer any forward guidance, the YTD revenue growth at +14.6% YoY and adj EPS growth at +27.1% YoY have been highly promising indeed.
Much of the success is thanks to the massive layoffs and successful Code Red initiative in 2023, allowing the company to generate renewed growth opportunities compared to the mixed FY2022 performance of +9.7% YoY/ -18.7% YoY, while building upon the FY2023 performance of +8.6% YoY/ +27.1% YoY, respectively.
The robust monetization of its growing AI/ Cloud and Advertising opportunities have naturally triggered the raised consensus forward estimates, with GOOG expected to chart an accelerating top/ bottom-line growth at a CAGR of +12%/ +20.4% through FY2026.
This is compared to the original estimates of +9.3%/ +11.6%, while building upon the historical growth rate of +19.1%/ +19% between FY2016 and FY2023, respectively.
While the robotaxi market remains nascent in the US, as compared to those in China, market analysts already expect the global robotaxi market size to grow rapidly from $1.73B in 2023 to $188.91B by 2034 at an accelerated CAGR of +53.21%.
While it remains to be seen whom may emerge as the market leader, we believe that GOOG's existing partnership with UBER is likely to accelerate its go-to-market process domestically/ internationally, allowing the former to tap into the latter's growing global consumer base at 161M (+3.2% QoQ/ +13.3% YoY) - improving the former's chances of long-term robotaxi success.
GOOG Valuations


This is also why we believe that GOOG is extremely compelling at FWD P/E non-GAAP valuations of 21.21x, compared to the 5Y mean of 25.72x and 10Y mean of 23.72x. This is attributed to its cheap FWD PEG non-GAAP ratio of 1.25x, compared to the 5Y mean of 1.48x and 10Y mean of 1.31x.
Even if we are to take GOOG's Magnificent 7 position into consideration, its attractive valuations can not be denied indeed, as compared to Amazon (AMZN) at FWD PEG non-GAAP ratio of 1.89x, Apple (AAPL) at 3.73x, Meta (META) at 1.20x, Microsoft (MSFT) at 2.45x, Nvidia (NVDA) at 1.40x, and Tesla (TSLA) at 7.10x - with it offering interested investors with an excellent margin of safety.

So, Is GOOG Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?

GOOG 5Y Stock Price


For now, GOOG has managed to recover from the worst of the July/ August 2024 market rotation, with the stock now running away from its 50/ 100/ 200 day moving averages while retesting the previous resistance levels of $175s.
For context, we had offered a fair value estimate of $174.20 in our last article, based on the LTM adj EPS of $6.97 ending FQ2'24 (+47.6% sequentially) and the 5Y P/E valuations of 25x.
Based on the LTM adj EPS of $7.54 ending FQ3'24 (+44.7% sequentially), it appears that the stock is trading below our updated fair value estimates of $188.50.
Based on consensus raised FY2026 adj EPS estimates from $9.82 to $10.10, there remains an excellent upside potential of +43.3% to our updated long-term price target of $252.50.
If anything, readers must note that GOOG remains inherently undervalued compared to its Magnificent 7 peers at the FWD P/E mean of ~44x and median of ~34x, as discussed above, with any upward rerating in its FWD P/E valuations potentially triggering an even richer capital appreciation prospect.
As a result of the compelling high growth and profitable investment thesis, we are maintaining our Buy rating for the GOOG stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732396-byd-stock-q3-2024-new-model-momentum-and-supportive-policies-driving-growth,4732396,"BYD: Q3 2024, New Model Momentum And Supportive Policies Driving Growth","Summary

 -  BYD's 3Q24 revenue surpassed Tesla for the first time since inception.
 -  Volume growth is likely to remain sustainable driven by superior value proposition in the budget EV segment.
 -  Supportive macro policies and trade subsidies adds an additional boost to demand amid China's soft macro backdrop.
 -  Tariff risk on export remains low as export accounts for only a high single digit of BYD's total auto volume.


BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF) reported 3Q24 results that were largely within consensus expectations. The net profit increased 11% to RMB 11.6bn, the highest quarterly net profit since its inception. The topline revenue of RMB 201bn grew by +24% y/y, surpassing that of Tesla (TSLA) for the first time.
The share sold off by -4% during Hong Kong trading as net profit per car came in at roughly RMB 9,300, a decline of 18% y/y and slightly below the consensus expectation of RMB 10,000. However, we are bullish on BYD’s outlook due to continued volume momentum and strong unit growth in October. Additionally, favorable macro policies support EV demand in China, and BYD will likely be a key beneficiary.
Q3 can be characterized by a slight product mix deterioration due to a higher concentration of the budget NEVs, offset by a slight improvement in gross profit margin.
We note that the sequential improvement in gross margin was due to the debut of the DM-i 5.0 plug-in hybrid, which drove roughly RMB 3k—RMB 6k in ASP on top of a lower cost structure than the last generation DM-i 4.0. This resulted in NEV's gross profit margin reaching 22%, driving an increase in gross profit per vehicle to RMB 35.6k, up +17% QoQ.
At the net profit level, it is worth noting that BYD Electronics, BYD’s assembly subsidiary, contributed roughly RMB 1bn to 1.5bn in attributable profit due to a better-than-expected gross profit margin.
If we are to net out BYDE’s RMB 1.5bn in net profit from BYD’s net profit of RMB 11.6bn, the net profit per car is roughly RMB 9,300.
In terms of volume, Song PHEV was the top-selling model, followed by Yuan EV and Seagull on a quarterly basis. However, the Qin L PHEV and Sea Lion 07 grew the fastest quarterly volume.
With a 35% market share in Q3 amid a highly competitive environment, BYD’s growth demonstrated solid execution driven by its competitive positioning and superior value proposition, in our view.
Based on the October data, the Q4 outlook for BYD appears to be positive. Domestic retail delivery surpassed 400k, reaching another record monthly volume since inception, while the wholesale volume hit another record high, surpassing 500k.
We are positive on BYD shares for the rest of the year, fueled by accelerated momentum from the new model rollout and supportive macro policies.
On the new models, both the Denza and Fangchengbao are off to a solid start in October.
For Fangchengbaothe off-road SUV, the wholesale volume hit a record high, up 11% MoM to over 6k units after reducing the price tag by around RMB 50k from RMB 290k to RMB 350k in July. The Bao5 off-road SUV is considered one of the popular luxury off-road SUVs in China. Besides the off-road feature that Chinese consumers widely seek after, the interior features a more high-end triple screen setup (two 12.3-inch instrument panels and a 15.6-inch central control screen) with physical buttons seamlessly embedded throughout the cabin to combine both tactile feedback and advanced tech.
We expect the price reduction to further drive consumer demand, and the recent trend is clearly positive. October retail sales exceeded 5k, outperforming its direct competitors, such as the Great Wall Motors Tank model, which sold around 3k-4k in October. The upcoming Fangchengbao Bao8 SUV could further accelerate the demand by year-end, given that Bao8 features the Huawei ADAS 3.0 system, which provides driver assistance features for both urban and highway environments.
Denza Z9GT also had a strong start since its launch in September, with 5k non-cancellable orders within 36 hours of the debut. The October wholesale volume indicates that this demand trajectory is likely to continue. We note that Z9GT saw a wholesale volume of over 3k, doubling from the prior month.
Besides the momentum of the new model, we also believe that the supportive trade-in subsidy policy towards EVs could allow BYD to be a key beneficiary. We note that on July 25, China’s National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Finance both came out with an announcement that focused on strengthening the trade-in for large-scale equipment and consumer goods in an effort to boost consumption.
The announcement raised the passenger vehicle subsidy by nearly 100% from RMB10k to RMB 20k per unit for NEV vehicles and RMB 7k to RMB 15k per unit for ICE vehicles. Given that this subsidy amount is the same for different price ranges, lower-priced vehicles are likely to benefit the most from this trade-in subsidy, given the higher cashback-to-price ratio. As such, low-priced NEVs produced by BYD are likely to be key beneficiaries, given that the majority of BYD’s NEVs lined up are focused on the low-priced segment.
Finally, the export risk remains low for BYD. We note that export volume as a percentage of total volume remains high in the single digits for BYD as much of the demand has been domestic rather than international. As such, we do not believe the recently announced tariff against Chinese EVs by the European Union will have a material impact on BYD's export numbers.
In conclusion, we are positive about BYD’s growth outlook after the 3Q24 result. We believe volume momentum is likely to be sustainable for the rest of the year, and the ongoing subsidy program will likely support the fundamentals. With the stock trading at 16.5x 2025E P/E and consensus revenue and EPS growth of 20%, we believe BYD is reasonably priced for long-term investors.
Risks to our thesis include China's macro overhang and the overall competitive environment. The market continues to anticipate a large stimulus package being rolled out by November 8, with some investors and economists hoping that the measures could drive consumer demand. If the stimulus measures are ineffective in driving consumer demand, then BYD is likely to face demand pressure in 2025. The lack of demand could drive further price competition amongst the auto brands. Although we are positive about the demand catalyst from Fangchengbao after the price reduction, as we pointed out earlier, we are concerned that profit per car could be under pressure if further price reduction is needed to stimulate demand.

 -  VICI remains a long-term winner in the gaming sector, attributed to the highly sticky tenant base and irreplaceable assets in Las Vegas.

VICI Is Inherently Undervalued - Offering Opportunistic Investors With The Dual Pronged Returns

We previously covered VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) in September 2024, discussing its robust FQ2'24 performance metrics and the raised FY2024 guidance, with it implying a potentially rich dividend hike in FQ3'24.
With its dividend investment thesis still rich and the management executing well on the diversification of its gaming/ non-gaming portfolios, we had remained confident on the REIT's ability to consistently generate profitable growth - with us reiterating our Buy rating upon a moderate pullback.
VICI YTD Stock Price


Since then, VICI has already pulled back by -4.8%, compared to the wider market at +1.4%. Otherwise, by -6.7% from the recent peak of $34.06, with the stock finally trading nearer to our last article's fair value estimates of $32.90.
Part of the pessimism may be attributed to the lower than expected dividend hike by +4.2% to an annualized sum of $1.73, compared to the last hike by +6.4% in September 2023 and the 5Y Dividend Growth Rate of +7.66%.
This is despite the REIT's robust H1'24 AFFO growth at +6.6% YoY (before the dividend hike announcement) - with it further underscoring why the stock may have lost part of their July/ August 2024 rotation gains.
Part of the headwinds may also be attributed to the tougher YoY comparison observed in the Las Vegas Strip's September 2024 performance, with gambling revenue declining by -1.8% YoY (attributed to the impact of Baccarat revenue on their earnings, otherwise, at +7.6% YoY), compared to +6.9% YoY observed in September 2023 (attributed to +87.8% YoY rise in Baccarat revenue).
Even so, we believe that VICI's recent correction has been a gift indeed, since it has triggered a richer forward dividend yields of 5.34%, compared to the 4Y mean of 4.9% and the REIT sector median of 4.23%.
If anything, the gaming REIT has reported a double beat FQ3'24 earnings call performance, with total revenues of $964.66M (+0.8% QoQ/ +6.6% YoY) and AFFO per share of $0.57 (inline QoQ/ +5.5% YoY).
Much of its tailwinds are naturally attributed to VICI's highly unique offerings in the gaming sector/ Las Vegas, with these assets typically being irreplaceable and as such, triggering the management's confidence of their ""tenants are economically compelled to renew the lease agreements due to the importance of our real estate to the operation of their business,"" including all of the periods covered by extension options.
This development has directly contributed to the REIT's extremely long Weighted Average Lease Term of 42 years and occupancy rate of 100% - triggering an incredibly deep insight into its long-term opportunities along with robust pricing negotiation power.
This is on top of the contractual rental escalation and CPI-linked escalation - allowing VICI to generate consistent top/ bottom-line growth, no matter the global macroeconomic situation.
Readers must also note that gaming sector has typically been term ""recession proof,"" as observed in the robust H1'24 commercial gaming revenue growth to $35.48B (+7.7% YoY) along with the ""14th consecutive quarter of industry growth in the United States"" by Q2'24.
These developments alone underscore VICI's robust long-term prospects, despite the Fed's sustained rate hikes since March 2022, the elevated inflationary environment, and the resultant uncertain macroeconomic environment.
As a result of these developments, it is unsurprising that the management has already raised their FY2024 AFFO per share guidance to $2.255 at the midpoint (+4.8% YoY), up from the original guidance of $2.235 (+3.9% YoY) offered in the FQ4'23 earnings call, despite the supposed miss from the consensus estimates of $2.61 (+21.3% YoY).
Based on VICI's raised FY2024 AFFO per share guidance and the recent dividend hike, we are looking at a relatively rich AFFO payout ratio of 76.7% as well, compared to its 5Y mean of 74% and the REIT sector median of 74.07%.
If anything, based on the YTD AFFO per share growth to $1.69 (+5.6% YoY), we believe that the management is likely to deliver another beat performance in the FQ4'24 earnings call, while offering a robust FY2025 guidance.
The Consensus Forward Estimates


This may also be why the consensus have maintained their forward estimates, with VICI expected to generate a relatively robust AFFO per share expansion at a CAGR of +4% through FY2026, building upon the historical growth at +7.8% between FY2018 and FY2023.
VICI Valuations


This is also why we believe that VICI remains reasonably valued at FWD Price/ AFFO valuations of 14.36x compared to the 5Y mean of 14.54x, while discounted from the REIT sector median of 16.70x.
Even when compared to its gaming REIT peer, Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (GLPI) at FWD Price/ AFFO valuations of 13.33x with the projected AFFO per share expansion at a CAGR of +3.4% through FY2026, we believe that VICI continues to offer an attractive investment thesis here.

So, Is VICI Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?

VICI 4Y Stock Price


For now, VICI has returned part of the July/ August 2024 gains, partly attributed to the selling pressure after the ex-dividend date of September 18, 2024 and the softer dividend hike.
Based on the management's raised FY2024 AFFO per share guidance of $2.255 and the 5Y FWD Price/ AFFO mean of 14.54x, it is apparent that the REIT is trading near to our updated fair value estimates of $32.70, thanks to the recent pullback.
Based on the consensus FY2026 AFFO per share estimates of $2.42, there remains a decent capital appreciation potential of +10.8% to our long-term price target of $35.20.
Combined with the richer forward dividend yields and B+ Dividend Safety Grade, as discussed above, we are reiterating our Buy rating for VICI.

Risk Warning

With VICI currently retesting its intermediate Q3'24 support levels of $31s, interested readers may want to observe the stock movement for a little longer before adding to their positions, with the same pullback similarly observed in the wider REIT market.
At the same time, with $2.05B of its debts maturing in 2025, readers may want to pay attention to the REIT's upcoming refinancing indeed. Despite the Fed's recently outsized pivot by 50 basis point in the September 2024 FOMC meeting, borrowing costs remain elevated compared to normalized levels.
While VICI remains profitable enough at an adj EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio of 3.75x while reporting a still reasonable adj EBITDA to debt ratio of 5.38x, we believe that it may be better to err on the side of prudence.
This is especially since the REIT has recently reported a new debt of $500M at an effective interest rate of 6.125%, elevated compared to the overall debt portfolio at a weighted average interest rate of 4.358% in FQ3'24 - with further refinancing at current expensive borrowing levels potentially bringing forth higher interest expenses and/ or bottom-line headwinds.
As a result, VICI investors will be well advised to monitor the management's intermediate term execution closely.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732431-federal-reserve-watch-good-shape,4732431,Federal Reserve Watch: Good Shape,"Summary

 -  The Federal Reserve continues to act in a way that will not disrupt the ongoing presidential election.
 -  The Federal Reserve, since it reduced its policy rate of interest by 50 basis points in September, has tried to be as low key as possible.
 -  The U.S. economy could not be performing much better from the Fed's viewpoint for the election period.
 -  The M2 money stock has grown 3.0 percent, year over year, and this seems to be consistent with where the Fed is going.
 -  Real economic growth is 2.7 percent, the price index the Fed concentrates on is at 2.1 percent, unemployment is near a 50-year low, and the stock market continues to hit new historic highs.


The presidential election is just around the corner, and the Federal Reserve continues to act in a way that will not disturb financial markets or set off a political storm.
Since the Federal Reserve lowered its policy rate of interest by 50 basis points at the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed has continued to reduce the amount of securities it holds outright in its securities portfolio.
In the past banking week, the week ending October 30, 2024, the Fed reduced its securities portfolio by $12.5 billion. Overall, the assets of the Federal Reserve declined by $17.0 billion.
Since the middle of September 2024, the Federal Reserve has overseen a $60.0 billion reduction in its securities portfolio.
Loans to commercial banks on the Fed's balance sheet declined by $37.2 billion during this time period, meaning that the Total Factors Supplying Reserves to the commercial banking system rose by a fairly substantial amount. The total decrease in factors supplying reserve amounted to $96.6 billion.
This movement, however, did not really increase the amount of Reserve Balances in the commercial banking system, as the Federal Reserve offset the reduction in the securities portfolio and the reduction in the Loan account by $95.6 billion.
Thus, reserve balances with Federal Reserve banks fell by only $1.0 billion from September 18 to October 30.


One could argue that the Federal Reserve, since its policy rate move on September 18, 2024, has done very little to disturb the commercial banking system of the United States.
Basically, the commercial banking system now has close to $3.2 trillion in excess reserves.
Looking at another source, the Fed's data on the commercial banking system (the H.8 statistical release of the Federal Reserve System), the commercial banks in the U.S. had, on October 16, 2024, a total of $3.3 trillion in cash assets.
Conclusion, the U.S. commercial banking system has lots and lots of ""cash"" on its hands. The U.S. commercial banking system has the cash on hand if it needs it to make loans or to protect itself from a market disruption.,
My continued belief is that Federal Reserve officials would like to reduce this total going forward. The Fed doesn't want to do it quickly, but the Federal Reserve leadership still believes that for ""normal"" operations, the commercial banking system still has too many ""excess"" reserves hanging around the result of the Fed's actions to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the following short economic recession.
So, the Fed will continue its program of quantitative tightening into the future. This is the number one priority of the current Federal Reserve program and will oversee a reduction in the commercial bank ""Reserve Balances"" as it continues to adjust its policy rate of interest to meet the ""needs"" of the banking community and the U.S. economy.

The Performance of the Money Stock

I have also written quite a bit recently about the performance of the M2 money stock.
I can now report that the performance of the M2 money stock should not be considered a concern of the investment community.
Over the past year, from September 25, 2023, to September 30, 2024, the M2 money stock has increased by 3.0 percent. This growth can be seen in the following chart.


This year-over-year increase should be sufficient to carry on the current economic growth of the country.
The year-over-year rate of growth for real Gross Domestic Product, as I have reported, came in at a very acceptable 2.7 percent for the third quarter of 2024.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure fell to 2.1 percent for September.
Note, that this good news followed the announcement that Eurozone inflation hit 2.0 percent in October, a report that is likely to lead to a further cut in the European Central Banks' policy rate of interest.
The year-over-year rate of growth of the M2 money stock should be very acceptable to Federal Reserve officials, particularly since the United States experienced a huge expansion of the money stock as the Fed pumped reserves into the banking system...as mentioned above...in order to combat the problems connected with the Covid-19 pandemic and the following short recession.
As suggested, the commercial banking system has the ""cash"" on hand to increase its lending and spur on higher rates of inflation.
The Fed needs to keep the growth of the M2 money stock under control so that these higher rates of inflation don't take place.
That is what its current path of policy is aimed to achieve.
The velocity of the M2 money stock has been increasing during this period of economic expansion but seems, at this time, to have slowed to a relatively modest rate of increase.
The velocity of the M2 money stock seems to have behaved in the recent past as ""trust"" in the Federal Reserve monetary program and the leadership of the Federal Reserve has grown.
This, of course, if a very crucial element for the Federal Reserve to move forward.
The Fed's two-and-a-half-year policy of quantitative tightening has built up this trust in what the Fed is doing. The Fed's securities portfolio is declining and the stock market of the U.S. has gone on to hit one new historical high after another, the rate of inflation has come down, unemployment has remained near a 50-year low, and the economy continues to expand at a reasonable rate.
What more can the Federal Reserve leadership ask for?
But, as alluded to above, the Federal Reserve leadership still has a ways to go, with the enormous bundle of liquidity in commercial banks, put there by the Fed as it massively increased its securities portfolio to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and the following recession, still hanging around in commercial bank balance sheets.
The hope is that the Federal Reserve will be able to continue doing what it has been doing...after the election.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732429-bruker-still-challenged-certainly-margins,4732429,"Bruker: Still Challenged, Certainly Margins","Summary

 -  Bruker's acquisition spree created a lot of uncertainty this year.
 -  While topline and organic sales growth is decent, earnings are down substantially.
 -  Conflicting actions by management and premium valuations create continued uncertainty here.
 -  I am The Value Investor. I've been researching financial markets for 10+ years using major business events as an indicator of future performance. I run the investing group Value In Corporate Events


In May, I believed that Bruker (NASDAQ:BRKR) had embarked on a confusing acquisition spree in recent times. The pace of a multitude of deals, unknown impact on sales, earnings and debt, raised some questions.
With management at the time not wiling or able to provide much clarity on the impact of the dealmaking spree, I understood why investors were acting with caution. This was certainly the case as a substantial share issuance followed at relative depressed levels.
Forwarding in time, the company has made a few additional bolt-on deals and while (organic) sales momentum has been strong, that is not the case for the bottom line, which is going on the reverse. All this makes me quite cautious here, as management still has to deliver here.

Post-Genomic Era

Bruker has been founded in 1960 and the company has generally focused on high-value analytical technologies, having over time transformed the business as new technologies arose with the passage of time. This made that the businesses needed to reinvent itself at multiple occasions in the past.
By 2022, the company generated about $2.5 billion in sales, generated by a workforce of more than 8,000. The vast majority of these sales were generated from scientific instruments (about 90% to be more precise), complemented by Energy & Supercon Technologies. The activities of the business mostly involve development and sale of equipment used by life science analytics, semiconductor, materials, and packing companies.
In 2023, the company grew sales by an impressive 17% to $2.96 billion, yet this only in part translated through to the bottom line, with adjusted earnings per share up just 10% to $2.58 per share. This strong year was somewhat unexpected, and despite the sound positioning of the business, the long term growth performance in the years before has been less impressive, although that investors benefited from substantial share buyback programs.

Peak Expectations Revert

Shares of Bruker peaked at $95 per share in March of this year, and based on the 2023 adjusted earnings numbers, it is evident that shares commanded premium valuations at multiples in the mid-thirty times earnings. The forward multiple was a bit lower, as the company guided for 2024 sales to rise by 10% to about $3.26 billion, backed by 6% anticipated organic growth.
Even as shares were down a bit in the spring, this still resulted in demanding valuations at the time. This came in part as the first half of the year has been dominated by a range of deals, some of these truly bolt-on deals, yet some being much larger as well. These included the purchase of Nion, Tornado Spectral, Chemspeed, Spectral Instruments Imaging, among others.
One of these larger deals was an EUR 870 million deal to acquire the European proprietary molecular diagnostics business ELITech, and a $393 million purchase of NanoString Technologies, with these latter assets bought out of bankruptcy.
Pegging the combined purchase of price of these deals at $1.5-$2.0 billion, I saw pro forma net debt at $2.3-$2.8 billion, for a leverage ratio around 3 times EBITDA, although all this was highly uncertain. Uncertainty was on the rise as first quarter sales grew by 5%, with organic growth reported at just a percent. First quarter adjusted earnings were down eleven cents to $0.53 per share, amidst slower organic growth and real margin pressure.
Adding to the uncertainty and confusion, management decided to sell 6 million shares by the end of May, in an effort to raise about $400 million in cash (excluding the over-allotment option). Investors voted with their feet, amidst a capital raise at relatively lower share price levels, being mostly concerned about the incoherent capital allocation strategy of the business.
While earnings multiples were down to around 24 times, while leverage remained substantial, and many questions could be asked, I failed to see immediate appeal around the $60 mark in May.

Trading Flat

Since May, shares have largely traded in a $55-$70 range, now trading at $58 and change per share. Following the confusing times of May, Bruker announced relative sound second quarter results in August.
The company posted a 17% increase in second quarter sales to $800 million and change, with organic growth reported at 7% and change. Despite the strong topline and even organic growth developments, adjusted earnings rose by just two pennies to $0.52 per share.
The company guided for full year sales to increase by 15%, plus or minus 1%, with revenues seen at a midpoint of $3.41 billion. Organic growth is set to boost sales by around six percent, plus or minus a percent. While the topline growth is quite solid, that is not seen on the bottom line, with adjusted earnings of $2.59-$2.64 per share being largely in line with a $2.58 per share number reported in 2023.
The worse thing is that the discrepancy between sales and earnings growth is not the result of additional interest expenses incurred following the dealmaking spree, as these interest expenses are adjusted or in the adjusted numbers! Net debt was reported at $1.99 billion, down a bit due to the equity issuance of May.
Despite the uncertainty in the business, the company continues to make bolt-on deals. In August, the company announced a minority interest in NovAliX, a French-based pre-clinical CRO firm. In October, the company acquired Dynamic Biosensors, another bolt-on deal set to add about $5 million in sales in 2025. While these deals are not big, it is the added dealmaking while the focus should be on organic profitability which send confusing messages to investors.

What Now?

The truth is that not much has changed since May. While the second quarter (organic) sales momentum has been strong, earnings have been lagging. Worse, after accounting for interest expenses, which are very real, profits are actually down, which is highly disappointing.
With realistic earnings trending at $2 and change here, current earnings multiples are high at nearly 30 times, while leverage is still substantial. That is a bit too easy as well. At current levels near the $60 mark, the company commands a near $11 billion enterprise valuation. With revenues trending just over $3 billion per annum now, the company trades at just around 3.5 times sales, but amidst this dismal margin performance, it trades at an elevated earnings multiple at the same time.
More will become clear next week, when Bruker is set to release its third quarter results. While revenues are set to show significant sequential revenue growth, with consensus estimates standing at $866 million in sales, adjusted earnings are seen at just $0.60 per share. Moreover, the definition of Bruker´s adjusted earnings excludes interest expenses, which is outright strange.
If the company can improve margins to historical ranges, there is real potential, but the trouble is that the company has a long way to go, as I do not expect quick fixes. While appeal is arguably improving amidst a stagnant share price and organic growth, I am not yet willing to get involved here just yet, as the proof of burden remains with management.

 -  For 2Q25, EA generated $2.03 billion in revenues, representing a year-on-year increase of 5.80%. Recent growth is attributable to the strength in the company's full games segment.
 -  EA's portfolio of games and new strategic initiatives is likely to accelerate the company's growth.
 -  In addition to revenue growth, the company is attempting to enhance its margin by focusing on its live service segment to expand top line while maintaining the cost of production.
 -  Valuation analysis suggests a potential upside of 13.80%. After factoring potential margin enhancement, a potential upside of 59% exists.


Introduction

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is a company that engages in the development and distribution of games for consoles, PCs, and mobile phones. EA's portfolio includes franchises such as Battlefield, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, The Sims, Need for Speed, EA Sports FC (formerly FIFA), and Madden NFL Series. Currently, the company generates revenue through two segments: (1) Live Services and (2) Full Games.
EA's recent 2Q25 results suggest that the company has successfully averted a third consecutive revenue decline, signaling the worst may be over for EA. Based on my analysis, there multiple reasons why EA will continue to do well: (1) the company has a robust portfolio of games, (2) there are multiple initiatives introduced to sustain its revenue growth, and (3) EA will be attempting to enhance its margins by focusing on its live services. More importantly, a valuation analysis suggests that potential upside opportunity exists for investors. In this report, I will demonstrate why investors should start accumulating the shares of EA.

Latest Developments

For 2Q25, EA generated $2.03 billion in revenues, representing a year-on-year increase of 5.80% and quarter-on-quarter increase 21.99%. The growth in the latest quarter indicates that EA has turnaround its sales after two consecutive quarters of declining year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter revenue growth. Recent growth is primarily attributable to the strong growth in the company's game sales segment, growing by 15.2% this quarter. Live services and other revenues remained slightly flat with a revenue growth of 1.23%
During this period, gross margin and operating margin have improved from 76.18% and 21.06% in the same period last year to 77.48% and 22.3% in the recent quarter. That being said, overall net margin declined from 20.85% in the same period last year to 13.83%. In fact, net margin also deteriorated by more than 300 bps as compared to last quarter.

Robust Portfolio of Games & Strategic Initiatives To Drive Revenue Growth

Over the past two quarters, the company posted an average revenue decline of 9.40%. The decline in revenues for both quarters can be attributable to a lack of major game releases. After two quarters of declining revenues, EA's revenue has finally turnaround, releasing major game titles such as Madden and EA Sports FC 25. For 3Q25, the company has already released NHL and the long awaited Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
Of course, we should not expect Dragon Age to break records like Black Myth's Wukong. However, EA's Dragon Age franchise has a longstanding fanbase. Although Dragon Age did not break any external records, it has already broken records internally. According to SteamDB, Dragon Age had achieve a concurrent player count of more than 70k, the highest for EA so far. As a reference, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor had an all time peak of 67k players.
Apart from Dragon Age, the company has unveiled other interesting developments during its recent investor day to maintain revenue growth. For the company's EA Sports series, the company will attempt to engage players throughout the entire year through ongoing content updates and special events. Currently, growth of the latest EA sports series continues to be strong.
Additionally, EA has confirmed that Battlefield's community testing program will come in by early 2025. Over the next five years, the company also expects to double net bookings from The Sims; recently, EA has partnered with Amazon MGM to work on The Sims movie.
Finally, in an attempt to move beyond gaming, the company plans to unlock new revenue generators starting with the EA Sports App. The EA Sports App will provide users with live sports data, analytics, and other exclusive sports related content. Although the company has not unveiled its monetization strategy, EA can monetize through subscription services or targeted advertising. The EA sports app will be released globally in phases; the app will first launch in Spain.

Higher EPS and FCF Through Margin Expansion

Based on its recent earnings call, EA's management has expressed their confidence in achieving material margin expansion from FY2025 up to FY2027. As stated during the company's investor day, the company will continue to focus its Live Services segment to scale up its topline while preserving its operating expenses.
For those who are not familiar with EA, Live Services is the company's attempt to extend the lifespan and engagement of their games; this model features new content, seasonal events, and microtransactions, providing new opportunities for EA to continue monetizing its current players. Through these purchases, EA will be able to generate additional revenue (e.g. in-game purchase such as exclusive seasonal skins) with reduced production costs (i.e., do not need to produce a whole new game). More importantly, through constant refreshes and updates, we should expect higher player retention that correlates with increased in-game spending.

EA Has Been Consistently Generating Cashflows and Returning Value to Shareholders

Historically, EA has been able to generate consistent cashflows. More importantly, the company has been returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Based on the company's historical cashflow statement, since 2020, the company has return shareholders approximately $6.13 billion, representing about 15% of the company's current market capitalization. A majority of these returns are done through retirement of shares.
Looking forward, investors should continue to expect EA to continue repurchase its shares. For 2Q25, the company has retired $375 million worth of shares and paid a dividend of $51 million. Earlier this year, EA had announced a stock repurchase program of about $5 billion. The stock repurchase program will run for the next three years and set to expire on May 2027.

Valuation Analysis Suggests Potential Upside

Based on the following assumptions: (1) EA to achieve its revenue guidance and improves its revenue growth by 2% a year, (2) EA to maintain its estimated margins through FY2029, and (3) a terminal growth of 2% and WACC of 8.92%, my discounted cashflow valuation model suggests EA's implied share price is 171.88, representing an upside of approximately 13.80%.
It is important to note that these are conservative estimates. If we factor in more aggressive estimates and assume that the company can improve its revenue growth by 3% a year and reduce its SG&A and R&D spend by 1% per year, the implied share price of EA is $240.29, representing a potential upside of approximately 59%

Closing Remarks

Overall, EA had proved that its recent revenue deterioration to be a short-term phenomenon. Apart from its new game releases, further developments in live services and margin optimization should continue to drive value for its shareholders. More importantly, the current share price of $151 is still considered cheap. If EA is able to accelerate its growth, investors should expect to see a potential upside of more than 13.80%.
Looking forward, investors should continue to keep a lookout on the developments surrounding the company's new games and the EA Sports App. If there is a delay on major games such as Battlefield, there is a huge possibility that the company's revenue will take a hit post FY2025. Margins may also erode if the company decides to ramp up its production team to resolve the delay.
As for EA Sports App, it will be imperative for us to monitor how EA sports can actually monetize their new offering. If the company is unable to figure out a way to monetize the EA Sports App, there is a likelihood that we will not see it beneficial to the company's financials; in a worse case scenario, EA may spend huge marketing fees in an effort to drive downloads without getting anything back, affecting its overall cashflows.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732426-vonovia-time-to-play-offence-with-a-capital-light-strategy,4732426,Vonovia: Time To Play Offence With A Capital-Light Strategy,"Summary

 -  Vonovia is pivoting to a capital-light business model.
 -  The deleveraging phase is now over as the German property market stabilized and rental growth continues unabated.
 -  It is time to play offence.
 -  Vonovia is not just waiting for rates to drop. This is a self-help story that enhances the franchise value.


In my previous article on Vonovia SE (OTCPK:VONOY) (OTCPK:VNNVF) in August 2024, I explained why Vonovia is my #1 defensive pick during a recession.
The below chart plotting Vonovia's share price versus the German 5Y Bond Yield shows the uncanny inverse correlation between its share price and interest rates:
So, in a recession, one would expect rates to decline, but as explained in my previous article, Vonovia's top-line rental income growth should be ~4% per annum, rain or shine. As such, one good reason to hold Vonovia in the portfolio is as a macro hedge to a recession or downside scenarios in the European economies.
However, the management team is not resting on its laurels and is actively pursuing a capital-light strategy which is going to be announced on the Q3 earnings call on the 6th of November 2024.
Currently, Vonovia EPRA NTA (European equivalent to net asset value or NAV) per share is EUR44.48 at the end of the June quarter. As such, Vonovia is currently trading at ~0.68x book value.
In this article, I will focus on the capital-light strategy and why this could prove to be a game-changer for the stock.

Company Background

Vonovia is Germany's leading residential real estate company. Vonovia currently owns or manages ~615K residential units, mostly in Germany, but with some apartments in Austria and Sweden.
While rental income from holding residential apartments is by far its main business, Vonovia also has additional segments that include:

Why does a capital-light strategy make sense now?

It is all about adapting to the current economic realities of higher interest rates compared to the past decade. Vonovia is directly impacted by higher financing costs and the past business model of acquiring low-yielding assets whilst benefiting from exceptionally low interest rates is unlikely to return soon. Over the next few years, Vonovia's cost of debt is likely to materially increase as it refinances debt maturities which will largely offset external rental growth, as such Vonovia has no option but to generate additional sources of income.
CEO Rolf Buch commented on this in the Q2 earnings call:
He further commented on the following:
It is clear the management team is focused on pivoting to a capital-light strategy but the details on how were not explicitly elaborated on.

What does a capital-light strategy look like?

A sensible capital-light strategy needs to leverage Vonovia's strengths which include its large scale, cost, and operational efficiencies and vast experience in residential portfolio acquisitions and deal-making.
As you can see below chart, Vonovia's scale and efficiency metrics in Germany are second to none:
This presents a unique opportunity for Vonovia to leverage its capabilities with third-party capital investors such as asset managers, private credit, pension funds, and insurance companies. The German residential asset class with its predictable, long-duration growing cash flow is attractive for such long-term investors and Vonovia is the perfect partner for such ventures.
Vonovia can identify target portfolios for acquisitions, manage the execution, and service the properties leveraging its operational excellence. At the same time, Vonovia can earn substantial capital-light asset management and service/property management fees.
The other large opportunity is maximizing the performance of Vonovia's value-add division which is its in-house craftsmen focusing on enhancing the value of existing properties and providing additional services to tenants. There are several growth opportunities for this division including the expansion of solar energy products and services. This could involve installing solar panels on existing properties, offering solar energy solutions to tenants, and providing solar energy to external customers.
There were several hints dropped at the Q2 earnings call that the value-add division is likely to strongly feature on the 6th November strategic announcements, including this comment from CEO Rolf Buch:
CFO Philip Grosse also added:

Final Thoughts

Interest rates matter for Vonovia given the direct impact on the financials with increasing funding costs as debt maturities get refinanced. However, Vonovia is also well-placed to deliver capital-light revenue to offset the rate headwinds. Vonovia's corporate governance, scale, and full-service model should enable it to attract third-party capital and develop an asset manager/property management capital-light business model alongside its proprietary investments.
The German property market has now stabilized and Vonovia has largely completed the deleveraging of the balance sheet. It is now pivoting to a capital-light business model (to an extent) and back into growth mode. This should have a positive impact on the share price and the investment thesis in the stock.
If rates decline in the Eurozone or a recession manifests, Vonovia is likely to outperform. Nonetheless, the management team is adjusting to the economic realities of higher rates for longer and thus it is a self-help story and not just merely waiting for rates to drop.
For these reasons, I remain very bullish and expect to hold the stock for many years to come.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732393-dynacor-laying-the-groundwork-for-global-expansion-dngdf,4732393,Dynacor: Laying The Groundwork For Global Expansion,"Summary

 -  Dynacor Group Inc. is a small-cap gold producer/ore processor with impressive shareholder returns, processing ores from artisanal miners.
 -  The company recently commissioned a pilot plant in Senegal, which begins a global expansion plan by the company that is expected to quadruple production to ~500koz within the decade.
 -  A diversified production base could attract institutional investors and analysts, which could re-rate the stock's valuation.


A few months ago, I initiated coverage on Dynacor Group Inc. (OTCPK:DNGDF)(TSX:DNG:CA), a little-known junior Canadian gold producer with operations in Peru.
Unlike other junior gold producers, Dynacor does not own any mines. Instead, the processes ores from artisanal miners. The savings in capital have allowed the company to organically fund its growth to become a significant gold producer with 2023 production of over 130koz of gold.
Looking forward, Dynacor recently embarked on its global expansion strategy by announcing plans to build a pilot plant in Senegal. If this venture is successful, I expect Dynacor will be able to attract institutional investors and analysts, which could significantly re-rate the company's valuation. I rate Dynacor a speculative buy
(Author's note, financial figures in the article are in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

Brief Company Overview

Dynacor is an impressive small-cap gold producer with a 10-bagger return since its 2008 IPO. But only a select few have heard of the company, why is that? To understand why, we must first understand the typical mining lifecycle and Canadian junior resource investment banking.
As a rule of thumb, my geologist mentor once taught me that only one in a thousand mining projects make it from initial discovery to production. Furthermore, the whole process is extremely capital-intensive; exploratory drilling, confirmation drilling, economic studies, mine permitting, and mine construction are all expensive and mandatory before a gold miner can produce a single ounce of gold (Figure 1).


So how do mining companies finance themselves? Since they are generally pre-revenue, mining companies usually must raise equity capital from investors. This is where the Canadian investment banks come in.
Independent Canadian investment banks like Research Capital and Ventum Financial have built most of their business around helping junior resource companies raise capital (Figure 2).


In fact, the focus on equity capital markets (where the fees are usually 5-6% of capital raised) is the reason why a micro-cap gold exploration company like Roscan Gold Corp (ROS:CA), with a C$36 million market cap can have 6 analysts covering the company, while a highly profitable gold producer like Dynacor only has 1 investment analyst covering it (Figure 3).


Dynacor is not well covered by analysts because the company does not have big capital expenditures and thus does not need to raise capital. Instead, Dynacor processes ores from Peruvian artisanal miners in its 600 tpd mill and produces ~130koz of gold per annum (Figure 4).


However, by not having to spend capital to explore, develop, and maintain mines, Dynacor has been able to grow organically while paying a significant dividend to its shareholders (Figure 5)



2024 Will Likely Be A Record Year

Looking at Dynacor's results, 2024 will likely be another record year for the company due to the surging gold price. In the most recently reported second quarter, Dynacor processed 42,935 tons of ore which were processed into 28,364 oz of gold. Year-to-date Q2/24, Dynacor has produced 60,133 oz of gold for US$135 million in revenues (Figure 6).


Furthermore, on October 16th, Dynacor announced third-quarter sales of US$76.2 million, which brings YTD sales to US$211.3 million, 14.5% higher than the same point in 2023 (Figure 7).


Given Dynacor's gross margins are typically very steady (the company effectively runs a tolling business), I expect the company to earn ~US$0.45-0.50 / share for the full year, a record for the company.

Laying the Groundwork For Global Expansion

In my initiation article, I noted that Dynacor was looking at opportunities to replicate its business model in other parts of Peru and the world. Building upon its 25+ years of experience processing ores, Dynacor has been evaluating global opportunities to establish ore processing plants with a goal of reaching annual production of ~500koz of gold production by 2030 (Figure 8).


The company appears to be laying the groundwork for its global expansion strategy as on October 11th, the company announced that it would commission a 50 tpd pilot plant in the Kédougou region, Senegal (Figure 9).


Senegal is a relatively stable West African country known for its democratic government and its significant gold industry. In 2023, Senegal produced an estimated 18 tonnes of gold, with approximately 7 tonnes coming from artisanal mines.
Since 2018, Dynacor has carried out several geological surveys in the eastern parts of the country, with the results demonstrating gold grades and ore volumes sufficiently attractive to justify a profitable operation.
According to management, some small local mining companies have demonstrated an interest in supplying ore to a processing plant, if one were to be established in the region.
Dynacor will look to build its pilot plant in early 2025, with the goal of using the pilot plant as part of its due diligence process to justify a commercial plant in the region.

Look For 'Analyst' Interest To Pick Up

If Dynacor greenlights a commercial plant in Senegal, investors should expect 'analyst' activity to pick up significantly, since a commercial plant will require tens, if not hundreds of millions in capital expenditures. With only $150 million in market capitalization, I expect Dynacor will have to raise external capital, which should attract investment banking interest (Figure 10).


Furthermore, with increasing global scale, Dynacor should also start to appeal to institutional investors, who typically do not want to invest in single-asset producers.

Risks To Dynacor

In my opinion, the biggest risk to Dynacor is the gold price, as the company's revenues are directly tied to fluctuating gold prices. When gold prices are rising, Dynacor also enjoys expanding margins, as it typically pays artisanal miners when ores are dropped off, but realizes sale proceeds when processed gold bars are sold internationally.
Another risk that investors need to consider is that Dynacor has no control over the grade of its ores. Variability in ore grades can lead to volatility in gold production and revenues. For example, in Q2/24, even though Dynacor processed 5.4% more ore than in Q2/23, gold production actually declined 13.2% YoY (Figure 11).


Finally, with the company embarking on global expansion in Senegal, there is always the risk that management may be entering unfamiliar territory and markets, and Dynacor's ore-processing business model may not be successful in Senegal.

Conclusion

I continue to like Dynacor's capital-light ore-processing business model that avoids typical mining expenses such as exploration drilling and mine construction.
One large catalyst on the horizon is the company's foray into Senegal. If the pilot plant is successful, an expansion into commercial operations could raise the company's profile among institutional investors and analysts, which could significantly re-rate the company's valuation.
I rate the company a speculative buy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732424-fairfax-financial-investors-in-awe-amid-recent-stellar-returns,4732424,Fairfax Financial: Investors In Awe Amid Recent Stellar Returns,"Summary

 -  Over the last three years, Fairfax has delivered amazing returns due to performance of its insurance subsidiaries.
 -  It trades at P/BVPS ~ 1.3 and may deserve even higher valuations due to the insurance business's ongoing growth.
 -  The stock may climb higher but, assessed conservatively, is a hold, due to valuations and risks.


I must start with a Fairfax Financial (TSX:FFH:CA) (OTCPK:FRFHF) chart.


What kind of miracle happened around 2021? Are there fundamental reasons for it? Is the chart going to continue straight up? How to value this beast?
Here is the basic background. Fairfax is a Canadian insurance company founded in 1985 by Prem Watsa, who was then 35. It trades in Toronto in Canadian dollars but reports in USD (US ADR is also available). Fairfax borrowed its model from Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) (BRK.A) and was so successful initially that the founder became known as Canadian Buffett.
It approached CAD ~$600 in 1998 but took another 16(!) years to repeat this achievement. After that - several years of inconsistent trading, COVID-related drop, and non-stop skyrocketing since 2021.

Berkshire, Fairfax, and everybody else

The Property and Casualty (""P&C"") industry is as ancient as Babylon because its products are badly needed or even mandated across business cycles. In most cases, the industry is not subject to technological disruption.
On the negative side, insurance is a commodity without economic moats, or so economists say. Practically, scale, capital, and underwriting expertise protect big insurers fairly well. Catastrophic (""cat"") events remain an existential threat to P&C carriers. However, diversification, various forms of reinsurance, and niche products mitigate or even hedge this risk.
As long as cat risks are manageable, P&C becomes attractive for investors due to its relative predictability over the long term.
P&C insurers possess funds from three sources: equity, long-term debt, and float. The latter designates funds received as customers' premiums before paying out claims. All funds from three sources can be invested and generate income. This is the reason why insurance is always related to investing.
Traditional insurers focus on underwriting while funds are invested mostly in high-grade bonds. A much smaller part, around 10% or so, may be invested in equities. Though countless variations exist, the principle remained unchanged until Warren Buffett.
For Berkshire Hathaway, underwriting remains a priority but funds on the balance sheet are invested in acquisitions of non-insurance companies and big long-term concentrated equity holdings.
Many readers of Buffett's letters interpret his words about float investing too literally. They think that Buffett courageously invests float in equities and acquisitions relying on his superhuman investment abilities. This is only partly true as displayed in the following table (all dollar numbers are in millions).


In most years, the sum of cash and bonds on the balance sheet exceeds float. (Please note that float is an accrual concept. Within the insurer's investment portfolio, ALL funds are bundled together without boundaries, similar to a joint bank account!) Only when equities are very cheap or when Buffett sees extraordinary acquisition opportunities does float exceed the sum of cash and bonds, like in 2008 and 2009 or recently in 2022. In these years, Buffett really invested float in equities.
Even though Berkshire often holds more cash and bonds than its float, the difference is typically small. In most years, Buffett aggressively invests funds outside float, maintaining only a modest cushion for unexpected events like cat events. This is feasible because Berkshire has multiple other cash sources, such as cash flows from subsidiaries, dividends from equity holdings, and untapped borrowing capacity. Traditional insurers’ management is seldom this bold.
Only a handful of companies went Buffett’s way including Fairfax. However, the difference between Fairfax and Berkshire is huge. Not only in terms of their market caps (~$30B vs ~$1T) but also in terms of their operating model. Fairfax is much closer to traditional insurers than Berkshire!

Fairfax and traditional insurers

(Re)Insurance companies represent 24.6/30.4~81% of Fairfax's assets as displayed on the balance sheet from the latest Prem Watsa's letter.


Non-insurance companies represent 2.4/30.4~8% of assets with the holding company's investments and cash representing the balance. It tells something about Mr. Watsa's thinking. He prefers to acquire insurers rather than other businesses! This differs from Buffett's operations.
At the end of 2023, Berkshire had ~$1,070B of assets on its balance sheet. ""Railroad, Utilities, and Energy"" constitute ~$259B or ~24%. The rest (~$811B) is called ""Insurance and Other"" which includes insurers and holding company cash and investments including stocks, manufacturers, retailers, etc. In Berkshire's 10-K, I did not discover the separate number for insurance assets. However, there is a clue. Statutory equity of BRK's insurers was $303B at the end of 2023. GAAP equity should have been higher and assets - higher still. My rough estimate of BRK's insurance assets would be below $500B or below 50% of its total assets.
Within the spectrum from traditional insurers to Berkshire, Fairfax is much closer to traditional insurers. And this partially explains Fairfax's recent success. Mr. Watsa made it very clear in his letter: ""We have benefited greatly from a hard market in insurance that began in 2019"". For many years, Fairfax was patiently buying promising insurance companies until unquestionably benefited from this when favorable conditions materialized.
Over the last ~10 years, Mr. Watsa made sizable investment mistakes. One of them was investing $1.375B in Blackberry back in 2014, a big part of which was lost. He characterized it as follows: ""Another horrendous investment by your Chairman. To make matters worse, imagine if we had invested it in the FAANG stocks! The opportunity cost to you our shareholders was huge! Please do not do the calculation! No technology investment for me!"".
Another of Mr. Watsa's mistakes was hedging Fairfax's exposure to equities for several years. The opportunity cost was significant as equities were marching ahead.
The unwinding of unsuccessful investments, the onset of a hard market in insurance, and share buybacks contributed to a rapid increase in Fairfax's book value per share—from $478 in 2020 to $979 in Q2 2024. This, in turn, led to a rerating of Fairfax’s valuation, with its P/BVPS rising from around 0.6 in 2020 to the current 1.3.



What is Fairfax's value?

In terms of P/BVPS, Fairfax is slightly less expensive than Berkshire. Typically, BRK trades around 1.5 but is about 1.6 now. On the same basis, Fairfax is about 1.3 which is not exceptional as displayed on the chart. Most of Fairfax's insurers have gradually improved their operations and consistently delivered combined ratios below 100% while quickly growing.
It is well demonstrated in the table from Mr. Watsa's last letter that lists main Fairfax's insurers:


Growth is important for valuations. Being much smaller than Berkshire, Fairfax is in a good position to grow faster and have higher valuations! It is hardly guaranteed, but 1.3 for the price-to-book ratio may not be the limit.
My regular readers know that I like to value Berkshire as the sum of equity and float. I explained the method several times in my publications with the latest here.
Imagine a P&C insurer that a)always underwrites profitably, b)consistently grows premiums, and c)reserves conservatively so that unfavorable development of prior years' reserves occurs rarely if ever. Both Berkshire and Fairfax, as well as good traditional insurers, fit this description.
Under these circumstances, our insurer can theoretically invest float the same way as equity since it will always have funds to pay claims from incoming premiums! Certainly, nobody is doing this but hopefully, you get the idea.
In practice, Progressive (PGR) - the best big insurer I know - trades higher than the sum of equity and float, Berkshire is close to the sum of equity and float and it makes sense to test Fairfax. The result is below:


The valuations are twice as low as that of Berkshire! And they are consistent with 2014-2015. However, I would argue that today's Fairfax is a stronger company than 10 years ago.
Both metrics (P/BVPS and P/(BVPS+FPS)) imply that Fairfax has still some room to grow, perhaps to P/BVPS of 1.5 in line with regular Berkshire's trading range. Berkshire's quality is beyond comparison, but Fairfax's insurance business may grow faster. Correspondingly, FFH's value may be about 1.5*979*1.36 ~ CAD 1,997 vs. its current price of CAD 1,786.

Conclusion

I should have bought Fairfax a couple of years ago or even in 2023 when it was trading at book value but missed it. Today it might be still a buy but I am less certain.
The soft insurance market may suppress insurers's growth rates and profitability and in the case of Fairfax, I would not rely on anything else as it appears too small to move a needle. The investment in Blackberry has shown risks associated with concentrated stakes in non-insurance businesses.
Staying overly conservative, I will rate Fairfax as ""Hold"" but will gladly revisit it if the stock valuations drop.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732423-sofi-the-turn-of-the-tide-has-come-technical-analysis,4732423,SoFi: The Turn Of The Tide Has Come (Technical Analysis),"Summary

 -  SoFi's near term technicals are strong as the chart indicates it is in both an accelerated and more modest uptrend.
 -  Its longer term technicals are a bit more mixed but the key signal is that the stock has just recently broken out of a long term downtrend line.
 -  SoFi's earnings results have been strong as revenue trends in the right direction and EPS makes further moves into positive territory.
 -  The valuation multiples remain at 2023 peak levels despite a significant improvement in its business, making the stock undervalued at current levels.
 -  Both technicals and fundamentals show the turning of the tide has come for SoFi stock and so I believe it deserves a buy rating.


Thesis

The turning of the tide for SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) may have finally arrived for investors. The near term technicals show that the stock is in a strong position as it enters into an uptrend that is supported by the moving averages and is confirmed by key indicators. Although the longer term technical signals are more mixed, the most important takeaway is that the stock is breaking out of a longer term downtrend that has weighed on the stock for years. A monthly analysis is not provided as SoFi only went public back in 2020. As for the fundamentals, revenue is back to trending in the right direction and EPS has been positive YTD, along with a recent uptick. Despite being in an arguable stronger position than in 2023, its valuation multiples remain below 2023 peak levels making the stock undervalued relative to its results. Overall, the turn of the tide seems to have arrived for both the technicals and the fundamentals and therefore, I initiate SoFi at a buy rating.

Daily Analysis


Chart Analysis

The daily chart is a highly positive one for SoFi. There is no resistance to speak of and plenty of support levels underneath the stock. In addition, earlier this year the stock broke out of a short term downtrend in July and is now in both a nearer term uptrend and an accelerated uptrend. Currently, the nearest support for the stock would be the accelerated uptrend line. This line only began in early October and has been rapidly advancing. It is nearing 11 and has already provided support on many occasions. However, since this trend line is very steep, it could show that the stock may be getting a bit ahead of itself and that this accelerated uptrend may not be sustainable. Even if it does break below this line, the stock would still remain in a near term uptrend, just at a lower pace. The next area of support would be in the 10.4s as that was a high set late last year and was actually support just days ago. Moving down, we have an upside gap at around 9.0 that could provide support. That level was also resistance early this year. We then have the slower uptrend line that began in August and is now nearing 8.5. Lastly, we also have support at around 8.0 as that level has been resistance on multiple occasions in the past year, showing its significance. Overall, in my view, the daily chart reflects a strong near term for SoFi as the stock is in a strong uptrend with no resistance in sight.

Moving Average Analysis

The positivity continues as we look at SoFi's daily moving averages. The 50 day SMA had a golden cross with the 200 day SMA in early October and since then the 50 day SMA has widened the gap very significantly with the 200 day SMA showing that the bullish momentum has been strong. The stock does trade a wide margin above both of the SMAs as the 50 day SMA's support is only in the 8.5s and could shows that the stock maybe a bit overextended at the moment. For the Bollinger Bands, after hitting the upper band and showing it was overbought in mid October, it just recently bounced off of the 20 day midline which is supposed to act as support in an uptrend. This is an important signal as it confirms the uptrend's strength. The midline is the closest MA support level as it nears 10 and is rapidly rising. From my analysis, it is clear that the short term technical outlook presented by these moving averages is positive.

Indicator Analysis

The daily indicators show a more mixed picture for SoFi. The MACD is currently above the signal line after a bullish crossover in early October. However, as you can see, the gap between the two has been closing as of late which could indicate that the bullish momentum has been decelerating lately. The MACD line's trajectory has improved in the past couple of days and so a bearish crossover can still be avoided. For the RSI, it is currently at 70.1 which is an overbought reading but it has receded from much higher levels seen in the middle of October. Being consistently overbought in terms of the RSI may actually not be such a bad thing as it could also indicate sustained momentum. The recent pullback in the RSI also shows that lately the bullish momentum has been receding somewhat. Lastly, for the stochastics, the %K has crossed below the %D within the overbought 80 zone which is a bearish signal. In addition, the stochastics, after being in the overbought zone for the vast majority of October, looks to be dropping out of that zone, again signaling that momentum is decreasing. In my view, it seems as though all three key indicators show that SoFi may be due for a corrective pullback in the near future as there are signs of weakness.

Takeaway

The overall short term technical outlook for SoFi is positive. The charts show that SoFi is in both a slower uptrend and an accelerated uptrend with plenty of support underneath while the moving averages also show bullish signals. As for the indicators, they show that some near term weakness is upon us and in my view, that is not at odds with the chart at all. Recall that I said that this accelerated uptrend may not be sustainable due to the steepness of the trend line and that the stock might continue the uptrend at a slower pace. The weakness that is unfolding in the indicators may show that this may be occurring and that the stock is simply entering a more sustainable and healthy but slower uptrend.

Weekly Analysis


Chart Analysis

There are many factors in play for the weekly chart. Firstly, the stock looks like it has broken a longer term downtrend with its recently rally, which is a highly positive sign. However, note that this breakout did not occur with extraordinary volume and that the previous week's candlestick was a doji indicating that the stock is indecisive as to its next move. Therefore, there is still some potential that this could be a false breakout. Longer term investors should view this breakout as a bullish signal but should still monitor the stock's activity near this downtrend line moving forward for signs of weakness. The stock currently has two resistance zones that I have identified. The first is at around 11.3 as that area is resistance currently and was resistance back in the middle of 2023. The other area of resistance would be in the 13.7s as this area was major support back in 2021. As for support, the first level currently would be the broken downtrend line but it is sloping down. We also have the gap at around 9.0 that was also identified in the daily analysis, but having a weekly gap reinforces its significance. Moving down we also have support in the 8.3s as that area was resistance in both 2022 and 2023. Lastly, we have distant support in the 6.5s as that area was support in late 2023 and during this year. Overall, I would say the weekly chart is a net positive one as the breakout is positive but investors should still practice caution as there are also some signs of weakness as well. Furthermore, we have both strong resistance and support for the stock and so the longer term is still a bit mixed for SoFi.

Moving Average Analysis

The 13 week SMA had a bullish crossover with the 26 week SMA earlier in the year and the stock has surged since that signal. The 13 week SMA has widened the gap with the 26 week SMA showing that there is accelerating longer term momentum. The stock also trades high above these weekly MAs as the 13 week SMA's support is down at only 8.78. For the Bollinger Bands, in recent weeks the stock has actually traded above the upper band showing that it was significantly overbought. As you can see above, SoFi usually pulls back a bit after extending beyond the upper band and so some near term weakness is not to be unexpected. The 20 week midline is currently between the two SMAs and may be support moving forward if SoFi enters into a sustained longer term uptrend. In my view, these weekly MAs show a positive technical picture for SoFi but the stock could correct a bit in the near future as it is overbought.

Indicator Analysis

The MACD is currently above the signal line after a bullish crossover earlier in the year. After widening significantly, the gap currently remains quite large showing that bullish momentum is still resilient. For the RSI, it is currently at 74 and the recent readings are the highest in history for SoFi stock. As discussed in the daily analysis, an overbought RSI reading may not be necessarily bad. Here, the all time high reading suggests to me that the recent rally could be much more than a bear rally and could indicate the turning of the tide in SoFi's favour. Lastly, for the stochastics, the %K and the %D are virtually at the same level and a bearish crossover within the overbought 80 zone could be imminent. However, during the previous crossover in September, the %K bounced back above the %D almost immediately and eliminated the bearish signal quickly. Therefore, the current stochastics should be monitored before drawing conclusions. Overall, despite some weakness in the stochastics, I believe these indicators offer a net positive long term view for SoFi as the RSI's record high cannot be taken lightly.

Takeaway

Although there were some mixed signals in these weekly analyses, I would conclude the overall message is still a positive one and indicates a strong longer term technical outlook for SoFi stock. Although there are some signs of weakness, the chart shows that the stock has broken out of a major downtrend which is a major positive. The moving averages show bullish signals even though the Bollinger Bands reflects that the stock maybe near term overbought, and the indicators, particularly the RSI, shows that this latest resurgence could be much more than a bear rally and could in fact signal a favourable turn of the tide.

Fundamentals & Valuation


Earnings

SoFi reported their 2024 Q3 earnings in late October and had generally strong results. They reported $697.121 million in total net revenue which is up 30% YoY. In addition, their adjusted net revenue figure of $689.445 million was an all-time high. As for EPS, they reported a diluted figure of $0.05, a significant improvement to the prior year period's $0.29 loss per share. Both of these figures beat expectations as adjusted revenue beat by $55.65 million and EPS beat by $0.01. As you can see in the chart above, revenue is re-accelerating QoQ for SoFi and EPS has entered into significantly positive territory. Things are trending in the right direction in terms of SoFi's financial results. Other highlights in their earnings include their net interest income being $431 million, up 25% YoY, and SoFi Money achieving record highs in their accounts, total deposits, and direct deposit members. Overall, in my view, this earnings report was strong and demonstrates the turn of the tide in SoFi's fundamentals.

Valuation

The P/B and P/S ratios have rebounded significantly from their lows but they are also still far beneath their peaks seen back in 2021. For the P/B ratio, it is currently near 2.0 after being at around 1.25 earlier in the year. Its current level is similar to the highs of 2023 but is still down heavily from the peak in 2021 of over 3.75. As for the P/S ratio, it is currently at 4.7 after nearing 2.5 earlier this year. Similar to the P/B ratio, the current P/S level is near peak levels of 2023 but remains far below the readings of over 7.5 in 2021. As you can see in the above revenue and EPS chart, after low QoQ growth at the start of the year, SoFi's revenue is back to trending strongly upward. In addition, EPS has been positive throughout this year with the most recent figure of $0.05 in Q3 being the best result YTD. If you look at results in 2023, revenue was growing at a healthy rate but the EPS was negative throughout most of the year. Despite being in an arguably stronger position than it was back in 2023, the valuation multiples are only at 2023 peak levels currently. Although the rate cuts by the Fed could potentially compress their interest margins moving forward, they could also expect higher activity due to those rate cuts and improved economic outlook. Therefore, I would conclude that SoFi deserves to be trading at higher valuation multiples than it did in 2023 and so the stock is moderately undervalued at current levels. In my view, the EPS trending significantly into positive territory and the revenue's re-acceleration is more than enough to justify the current valuation.

Conclusion

The technical and the fundamentals converge to the result that SoFi's stock is attractive at current levels. The near term technical analysis shows that the stock is in a highly positive situation as it remains in both an slower and accelerated uptrend. While the long term technicals have some signs of weakness, they were net positive with the breakout of the long term downtrend being the key signal. For the fundamentals, revenue is back on the right track and recent EPS figures have been impressive. The valuation multiples have remained near 2023 highs while SoFi's business is in better shape than it was back then. Although upcoming lower rates could cut into their margins, the increased economic activity is likely to heavily compensate for those lost margins. Therefore, I conclude that SoFi's turn of the tide has come and the stock deserves a buy rating.

 -  Intel reported a revenue beat but a huge EPS miss due to restructuring and impairment charges.
 -  The company mentioned a key partnership with Amazon Web Services for next generation CPUs on built on Intel 3 and an ""AI fabric chip"" built on Intel 18A.
 -  While challenges and risks remain, I upgrade Intel to a Buy and believe this is a turning point.


Q3 Earnings Report

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are up after a decent earnings report gave investors an update on the transformation of the American semiconductor giant. Revenues of $13.28b, while down 6.2% from this quarter last year, beat analyst estimates by $240m. The company had billions in impairment and restructuring charges cause a $0.43 miss on EPS which came in at -$0.46. Intel CFO David Zinsner said ""restructuring charges meaningfully impacted Q3 profitability as we took important steps toward our cost reduction goal... The actions we took this quarter position us for improved profitability and enhanced liquidity as we continue to execute our strategy. We are encouraged by improved underlying trends, reflected in our Q4 guidance."" Intel is making progress on sweeping organizational simplifications and is progressing toward delivering $10b in cost reductions in 2025. The company also expects to return to nearly a 40% gross margin with positive non-GAAP EPS in Q4 2024 with revenues between $13.3-$14.3b.
The company's Q3 gross margin fell materially YoY from 42.5% to 15% due largely to $3.1 billion of charges, substantially all of which were related to depreciation expense for the Intel 7 process node. Excluding these charges, gross margin was roughly flat YoY at 38%. In the 10-Q, the company states that these charges were because manufacturing capacity of Intel 7 is higher than market demand for the node. Weak demand for Intel Foundry has been the defining characteristic of the company's struggles, and these struggles were persistent this quarter.
The company's beleaguered desktop segment declined 18% in the quarter, bringing in just over $2b, while the notebook segment grew 9% to $4.89b. Revenue from the Intel Products segment overall was slightly down due to desktop weakness, partially offset by notebook strength and slight growth in the data center and AI segment (""DCAI""). DCAI revenue grew from $3.08b to $3.35b YoY. The lack of growth in DCAI amidst the industry boom now leaves Intel securely in third place for merchant silicon providers in the US AI hardware. Nvidia (NVDA) is definitively in first and AMD's (AMD) recent report showed their AI accelerator sales at $3.5b, placing them second. The lack of demand for Intel's Gaudi line of accelerators underpins the importance of the company's re-emergence as a reliable leading edge foundry partner.
The Foundry segment was also weak in the quarter, bringing in only $4.3b this quarter versus $4.7b this time last year. The only meaningful contributor to operating profit in Q3 was the client computing segment (comprised of desktop and notebook), with DCAI segment operating margin at about 10% and the Foundry segment generating a significant loss. Still, Intel is powering ahead with the five nodes in four years strategy. Progress on Intel’s fifth node in four years, Intel 18A, is ""healthy and continues to progress well, and the company’s two lead products, Panther Lake for client and Clearwater Forest for servers, have met early Intel 18A milestones ahead of next year's launches."" Further, Intel and Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (""AWS"") are finalizing a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar commitment to expand the companies' existing partnership to include a new custom Xeon 6 chip for AWS on Intel 3 and a new AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A. This marks a huge milestone for the company in finding a major external customer. Both Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest are Intel Product Group chips.

Looking Ahead

Intel sits at a crossroads right now. The company is suffering from share loss against AMD in the x86 market while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is far ahead of Intel in the dedicated foundry market. AMD continues making progress in data center CPUs and GPUs and has a very competitive chiplet platform that offers customers flexibility and cost efficiency. Meanwhile, TSMC owns the vast majority of the industry's most profitable chip manufacturing contracts while Intel works on standing up the 18A process node.
18A will be the first Intel node that is competitive with TSMC from a technological standpoint in many years. What is really promising is that Intel is working with Amazon to design and manufacture chips on the 18A process node. This will be a critical early win for the company if they can close the deal in 2025 and something that speaks to the broad-based strength of Intel's product portfolio.
Despite current weakness in both the foundry and products segments, Intel has compelling value propositions in advanced packaging and the 18A process technology. 18A will be the first manufacturing node to feature ASML's (ASML) high-NA EUV, backside power delivery, and gate-all-around transistors. Each of these represent key disruptions in the foundry industry and makes 2025 a turning point for chip manufacturing. Of course, 18A yields and cost will be critical, and failure is still very possible. However if there was ever a time for Intel to leapfrog TSMC it's right now.
This report was just strong enough to warrant an upgrade in my Intel rating, from Hold to Buy. In my previous article, titled Intel Stock: Long-Term Success Seems Likely, But The Path Forward Remains Uncertain, I discussed key market dynamics in both x86 and foundry. I made the claim that AMD's product superiority threatens Intel as AI PCs begin to rise but made many of the same points in that article as I made today. Intel's key headwinds are its bleeding foundry segment and rapid share loss to AMD in data center CPUs. However, Intel remains at the forefront of industry innovation with the 18A process node, its advanced packaging capabilities, the early adoption of high-NA EUV, and backside power delivery. This report confirms progress and solidifies hope that 18A will be in volume manufacturing beginning 2025 with gate all around transistors and a backside power delivery network. If Intel can successfully navigate yield and cost considerations, these two innovations alone will be a catalyst to a very successful year for Intel investors in 2025.
This quarter is likely the inflection point for the company as they put major restructuring and impairment charges in the rearview mirror and look forward to ramping new process nodes and technologies. Intel stock is now worth the risk, and I recommend a Buy after Q3 earnings.

 -  Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has delivered yet another quarter of material cash flow growth, while maintaining a robust balance sheet.
 -  From Q3 2024 earnings data points and messages, it is clear that EPD has stepped up its investment game.
 -  Given EPD's upper investment grade credit rating, 1.7x distribution coverage and inherently stable business model, the risks of funding the ambitious growth at the expense of financial safety are limited.
 -  In this article, I explain in more detail why EPD, which was already my favorite MLP pick, has become an even more attractive durable income play after the recent Q3 earnings report.


I have been actively covering Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) since the start of this year with the recent article issued back in late July, when EPD circulated its Q2, 2024 earnings report.
The investment case was rather straightforward and consisted of the following building blocks:
Considering the points above and the offered yield by EPD of roughly 7.3%, I labeled this particular MLP as my favorite, especially for capturing truly durable and attractive income streams.
So far this year, EPD has delivered ~ 17% in total returns, which, theoretically, might raise questions whether the Partnership is trading in an overvaluation territory.
However, looking at the Q3 2024 earnings report and the current fundamentals, I doubt that this is the case. In fact, in my opinion, EPD has got even more attractive income play after the recent data points.
Let me explain.

Thesis review

Financial performance and serviced volume wise, EPD delivered yet another robust quarter. It reported Q3, 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion, compared to $2.3 billion the same quarter last year. Importantly, the adjusted cash flows from operations, which reflects the actual cash flow generation better, increased by 4% to $2.1 billion.
From the handled volume perspective, EPD set 5 individual records, which just as in the case of financial performance, was accommodated by several growth CapEx assets coming online and fully contributing to the Q3 financials (i.e., mostly 3 new natural grad processing plants).
This dynamic just shows how important it is to keep a healthy level of investments to secure at least above inflation-rate growth.
Now, in this particular context, it is worth underscoring that EPD has stepped up its investment game. The Management has updated 2025 estimated growth CapEx range to $3.5 billion to $4 billion due to emerging opportunities in the MLP space that are primarily associated with the demand for natural gas (stemming from AI-driven data centers).
Here, the quote from Jim Teague — Co-CEO during the recent earnings call captures the story nicely:
There are two takeaways from this:
On top of the organic CapEx spend, EPD also seems quite active on the M&A front, by, for example, acquiring Piñon Midstream for $950 million. There, the underlying assets offer strong synergies to EPD's current Permian processing footprint through advanced and already established treating services and deep NGL-related value (asset) chain.
The question or theoretical risk could around the financing and the level of incremental financial risk that all of these expansion plans imply. Looking deeper at the current cash flow generation of EPD and considering the state of the balance sheet, there is no material reason why we should get concerned.
First, currently, the leverage ratio for EPD stands at 3.0x, which is one of the lowest in the sector and a clear indicative of a robust capital structure (as confirmed by the upper investment grade credit rating). Since EPD has established its target leverage range between 2.75x and 3.25x (to maintain upper investment grade credit rating), it has some room left to assume debt without breaching the ceiling level. Even if the leverage ratio exceeds 3.25x, I doubt that it will be for a long time and significantly above that given EPD's stipulated target range and commitment to maintaining the current credit rating.
Second, even though EPD has paid out ~ $4.8 billion (including $252 million of buybacks) to its limited partners over the TTM period, it has managed to retain approximately $3.7 billion of cash in the books (i.e., the TTM adjusted cash flow from operations payout stands at 56%). What this means is that, actually, the lion's share of the projected CapEx spend could be covered by using equity and only relatively small portions of additional debt, thereby allowing EPD to keep the leverage ratio stable (at least when we speak about CapEx and not M&A).
Third, and this is critical to understand, each investment and especially M&A comes with its own cash flow contribution, which offsets the leverage costs, provides incremental EBITDA and, ultimately, balances the leverage profile. This is precisely what we can see from Q3, 2024 financial dynamics, where mostly because of the new assets, EPD has managed to register decent growth.
The data below illustrates the growth CapEx list with the forecasted in-service dates. The list encompasses $6.9 billion of investment, representing 11% of EPD's market cap.


The positive thing here is that already next year in Q3 we should experience a notable boost to EPD's cash generation from many larger scale projects kicking in.

The bottom line

All in all, EPD has delivered a decent quarter yet again, registering positive cash flow growth dynamics and, more importantly, sending clear signals to the investors that the intention is to expand the business going forward.
Effectively, this means that EPD could be considered a durable income case, where the underlying income streams will be subject to decent growth going forward. Namely, EPD provides a solid defense with a yield of 7.3% and tangible (already in the CapEx realization process) income growth, where the funding mix is not that heavily weighted towards additional debt.
We have to of course be cognizant of the risks to such a thesis with the commodity price risk being the most critical one. However, as explained in my previous article, there are several fundamental risk mitigating factors in place:
In a nutshell, EPD remains my favorite MLP income pick.

 -  The S&P500 provides a meager 1.2% yield, besides a roller-coaster ride on a regular basis. Unless you are comfortable with the idea of selling shares to raise income, it is not suitable for most retirees.
 -  An all-weather portfolio for retirement needs to function reasonably well during all kinds of market conditions, not just during the bull market. It should provide lower volatility and drawdowns, reasonable growth, a 4% to 5% income, and preservation of capital.
 -  These are some hefty goals, and we will attempt to structure our portfolio around them.
 -  I am Financially Free Investor, an independent analyst with 25+ years experience. I run the investing group High Income DIY Portfolios which focuses on dividend-growing stocks for long-term passive income.


Introduction:

Thinking and planning for retirement can be both exciting and stressful. On the one hand, retirement is the beginning of a new chapter in life, where your day-to-day schedule will be nothing of the kind that you may have been used to. On the plus side, you will have a lot of flexibility and time that you can plan according to how you want to spend your day versus how somebody else or outside factors determine your day. Now, it will be possible to do things or follow your interests that you have always wanted to do but never had the time or resources to do. It may be from simple things like growing a vegetable garden or working in your garage on pet projects to playing golf three times a week or touring the rest of the world. Your biggest asset in retirement will be the availability of time to do whatever interests you. However, how effectively you can use that time will depend on the resources. You will no longer have the comfort of a regular paycheck on a fixed date. You need to plan your financial resources according to your needs, interests, and hobbies. If your financial resources are limited, your hobbies need to be inexpensive, too. For example, growing a vegetable garden or working on carpentry projects is much cheaper than playing golf 3 times a week or vacationing in Europe twice a year. So, it is best to start defining your retirement goals and making an investment plan at least in your early 50s, if not sooner.
Whatever your goals may be, in this article, we will attempt to provide an all-weather financial portfolio. This portfolio will not need you to spend much time researching and analyzing stocks and financial markets. Also, there should not be a need to monitor our investments on a daily or frequent basis. Still, the portfolio should provide you with the necessary growth, income, and protection against tough market conditions like deep corrections and recessions.

All-Weather Retirement Portfolio:

To actually qualify this portfolio to be an all-weather retirement portfolio, we will aim for the following set of goals:
The portfolio should preserve and grow the capital on a long-term basis. All investments carry risks; however, the portfolio should be able to mitigate the risks to a large degree. In addition, during deep corrections or times of stress, the drawdowns should be much lower than the broader market.
The portfolio should not be short on growth. A portfolio can be moderately conservative and still provide the necessary growth to meet the needs of a long retirement. Retirements can easily last 30 years or more these days and the portfolio should grow fast enough to outlast the owner while providing income all along.
The overall income from the portfolio should be at least 4% to 5%. If more was needed, then some withdrawals (based on selling assets) should be considered, but only in emergency situations.
The portfolio should have low volatility and should require minimal maintenance or monitoring. Not everyone has time or interest to spend a lot of time researching stocks or financial markets. Also, with time, as a retiree moves from the 70s to 80s, there are situations where a hands-free approach may be desirable. That's why the portfolio should allow some flexibility to the retiree to determine how much time they want to spend. They should be able to switch from moderate engagement to a very low level of engagement.
We will have three components (or Buckets) in this portfolio:
The first two buckets are buy-and-hold and very easy to implement. They require very minimal effort to buy the securities at the beginning and simply hold them. It requires very little monitoring or maintenance as they are invested in broad-based funds or ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). You could rebalance them just once a year.
However, as we will explain in the next section, the third bucket (being a Rotational Bucket) requires some ongoing effort on a monthly basis. In our estimate, it requires no more than half an hour on the last trading day of every month. The purpose of the third bucket (Rotational) is two-fold: to enhance the overall performance (or growth) of the portfolio while reducing the drawdowns at the same time.
However, the overall structure of the portfolio provides a lot of flexibility in terms of how many buckets we may want to have or what allocations we want to assign to each bucket. As a retiree moves from their 70s to 80s (or mid-80s), they can forgo the rotation bucket entirely and reallocate the funds in the first two buy-and-hold buckets. In the case of only two buy-and-hold buckets, we could allocate 60% to bucket-1 and 40% to bucket-2. These buckets are the building blocks of the framework that you can use to form your own portfolio to suit your individual needs.

(I). 6-Funds Buy-and-Hold Bucket: (50% Allocation)

We will select 6 funds (ETFs and CEFs) from SIX different sectors. This bucket will be allocated 50% of the total capital. The first four funds will be allocated 20% each, while the last two (real estate and energy MLPs) will be allocated 10% each.
Table-1:

(II). Asset-Based Buy-and-Hold Bucket: (25% Allocation)

This buy-and-hold bucket will invest in six securities, each of them representing a different or unique asset class. The purpose is that they generally move in different directions; for example, GOLD may have very little correlation with stocks most of the time. The major share is allocated to stocks, to the extent of 40%, with the other five assets representing 12% each of the portfolio.
Table-2:

(III). Asset Based ROTATIONAL Bucket: (25% Allocation)

This bucket will take the same SIX securities as in Bucket-2, and use the ROTATIONAL strategy to generate superior returns with lesser drawdowns. This will help improve the growth profile and lower the volatility of the overall portfolio. This strategy will rotate every month and invest in two of the best securities (out of six) every month. So, it is essentially a momentum-based rotation that attempts to stay in the top two assets at any time. These six assets (as represented by six securities) have a tendency to diverge from each other; however, at times, they can move in sync as well, but that is rare.
Note: This bucket does require some work on a monthly basis, but the effort is minimal. Investors who cannot commit to this work should just invest bucket-3 capital in Bucket-2, which is buy-and-hold.
Rotation Method: Every month, we will calculate the total performance returns (including any distributions) over the previous three months from each of the six securities and sort them in the order of best performance to the worst. We will then take the top two securities and invest the bucket-3 capital in these top two securities equally. We stay invested for the entire duration of the month and repeat the same process again on the last day of each month.
Asset-based Securities in the pool: (same as bucket-2)
Table-3:

Past Performance of Rotation Bucket:

A comparison of Bucket-2 and Bucket-3 for the period from Jan-2006 to Sep-2024 shows that even though they have the same assets to invest in, bucket-3 outperforms bucket-2 (as well as S&P500) by over four percentage points on average annually for roughly 19 years. An amount of $10,000 invested in the Rotational bucket would have grown to $145,000, compared to $71,000 and $65,000 for the Buy-and-hold Bucket-2 and the S&P500, respectively. So, a 4-percentage point difference on an annual basis can make a big difference over 19 years. Also, please note that the maximum drawdown of the rotational bucket is nearly 60% less than that of the S&P500 and 40% lower than that of the buy-and-hold bucket-2.

3-Bucket Combined Portfolio vs. 60:40 Stocks/Bonds Portfolio

Here is the comparison chart between our combined 3-bucket retirement portfolio and a balanced 60:40 Stocks/Bonds retirement portfolio since Jan-2007. For backtesting purposes, we had to replace some of the securities in the fund's portfolio, for example, JEPQ with ETY and SCHD with ADX (prior to the year 2012).

Concluding Thoughts:

It is always recommended to start planning for retirement as soon as possible, but it must happen by the time you are in your early 50s. At that point, the more you delay, the tougher and harder it will get to achieve your goals for a comfortable retirement. All that said one should start saving at an early age as the compounding effect from an early age can be very powerful. For example, a dollar invested in your twenties can be the same as 2 dollars invested in your 30s and 4 dollars invested in your 40s.
In our view, we have provided an all-weather financial portfolio that is highly diversified, reduces volatility by 20% to 30% compared to the broader market, and provides superior performance. This portfolio will not require you to spend much time researching and analyzing stocks and financial markets. Still, the portfolio should provide you with the necessary growth, income, and protection against tough market conditions like deep corrections and recessions.

Daniel Snyder: We are thrilled to have Laura Starks with us today. She is CEO and Founder of Starks Energy Economics, and we're going to be diving deeper into the energy sector.
We're going to cover everything from how the U.S. has become a lead energy producer to, is nuclear the future, as well as what is happening in the LNG renaissance.
So let's go ahead and dive right in. Laura, how are you?
Laura Starks: Great, and I'm happy to be joining you from the Energy Capital of the World, Houston, Texas.
DS: Love to hear it. So why don't we just kick things off? What's the lay of the land for the U.S. energy sector right now?
LS: For those who may not be able to see it, this is the U. S. primary energy consumption by source. And I want to emphasize the word primary. And what it shows are – it's a pie. It shows petroleum is 38%. We're talking about 94 quadrillion BTUs, and petroleum was 38%, natural gas was 36%, nuclear 9%, coal 9%, and renewable 9%.
And then it's good to look at the renewable piece of the pie. That breaks down further to about 23%, let's see, 32% biofuels, 5% biomass, 18% wind, 23% wood, 10% hydro, 1% geothermal, and 11% solar. And so multiplying that out, for example, in 2023, in primary energy, wind was about 2% of the total and solar was about 1%. And it's just useful to keep that in mind for context for reasons I'll be describing.
Okay. And this is just a quick listing, and these are both from the EIA, the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And it talks about how do we use these primary sources of electricity. Electric power, electricity is a secondary source. You have to have primary energy to make it.
That's 32 quads, transportation, which is pretty largely oil-based, is about 28 quads quadrillion BTUs, industrial 22, residential 6.3, and commercial 4.6. And residential and commercial are electricity and heating, excuse me, primarily.
DS: Now this is for 2023. From what you've seen so far, is this kind of shaping up to be similar for 2024 as well?
LS: It is, but that's an excellent question. What we have seen is growth in electric power demand and unprecedented growth. Many people have heard about the AI story and we'll talk a little bit more about that.
Suffice to say that electricity has been – use has been pretty flat, which just means we're pretty efficient, and now it's growing 2% or 3% a year, and that's off of a very big base. So a lot of the utilities and the new users in AI are kind of scrambling for sources.
DS: What about the sources of U.S. electricity?
LS: We have seen a big shift over the last 15, 20 years. If I had shown you this slide, and it's just a box that shows the different kinds of primary sources. If I'd shown you this 15 or 20 years ago, you would have seen coal as more than half of the supply and some residual fuel, oil, nuclear. Nuclear has stayed fairly constant, far fewer renewables and far less natural gas.
So what has happened is that in the electricity sector, particularly there's been quite a big penetration by renewables. So that's now about 21% - was 21%. Nuclear 19%, we'll be talking about how that's been steady, but it’s – people are hoping to change that. Coal is quite small, it's shrunk, as people have shut down plants in response to emissions requirements.
So that's 16% and natural gas is 43%. And it doesn't really show on this, but those sources have different characteristics for the grid. And so they are each important in different ways.
DS: So we have this for the electricity. What about energy consumption and the overall sectors, what's the lay of the land there?
LS: A lot of oil, for example, goes to transportation. I think the main thing to observe about it is there are two bars, one is sources, one is uses. But in between, there's this very big bar that is electricity and it is both a source and a use, but it is a secondary source as we have discussed.
DS: This chart right here was just breaking down all of the sources of oil, how it's utilized, a small portion of it for electricity, and the rest of the end cases being transportation, airlines, for example, with jet fuel, things like that. So thank you so much for taking the time just to kind of like lay the land for us in the energy sector.
But it's an election year. What happens to the energy sector if Trump wins or if Harris wins? Can you kind of give us a little bit of what you're seeing and what you're anticipating?
LS: With Harris, it's pretty straightforward, because if she wins, we can expect more of the same. So – and there are – there's been a lot of emphasis on renewables, but there's also been a lot of efforts to transition away from hydrocarbon, both as a supply and as demand.
And I think with – so continuing the same, I think as Trump has said, his focus would be less regulation, more emphasis on supply. So kind of back to before the Biden administration, definitely lift the pause on LNG permitting, which has been a huge problem for both for us and for our buyers abroad.
And there – one of the things, for example, too, is that the regulations have been pushed in the direction of limiting supply. So, for example, there were no offshore Gulf of Mexico auction – lease auctions this year, in first time ever.
And those projects, in particular, with LNG are long-term. And so you can't just - sure you can kind of just turn off and on. The LNG projects and offshore drilling and international drilling is – it's a far more expensive and capital-intensive business.
DS: Within the LNG space, because you were mentioning about the permitting and what's happening in the Gulf, we've seen over the last few years with the war in Ukraine, for example, and Europe starting to be a bigger buyer of U.S. LNG, do you anticipate that to continue into the years ahead?
LS: I do. The bigger source is, or the bigger demand source is Asia. Europe was very – Europe was – Europe got slammed, particularly Germany. And so much so that they have, yes, with the Ukrainian situation, but also in Germany, this push toward renewables, they've actually headed in the direction of deindustrialization.
We were very happy and it was important that we were able to supply LNG to European countries. And we see, for example, in Spain, there have been more – and Germany, more LNG import facilities built and that all works really well.
The only concern has been, at least it was, because of the push to renewables, LNG terminals required long-term contracts. And a lot of the European countries were kind of, like, oh, we want to do four years and five years or six years. So it's hard to finance on that basis. You can't.
At the same time, we were supplying as much as they could take and they would take. Asia, because of its reliance on coal and it’s sort of long-term industrial growth is really a very important market also for LNG.
And here's the problem with the pause. The pause says, oh wait, we can't make a 20-year deal. And both sides, the buyers and the sellers need to do that in order to build the terminals.
DS: Maybe we can also talk about how each administration is approaching fracking within our country. Obviously, we watch West Texas, we're watching Pennsylvania. What are your thoughts on how each of these candidates will approach that?
LS: Trump – the merit here is that he's been in office. And so he kind of continued and encouraged the work that was being done with fracking. Fracking is – it's important. It's a homegrown technology. It's very quick turnover.
With Harris, there are different views. I mean, she's said different things. So I'm not really sure where she is on that. Of course, because everybody's pushing Pennsylvania and fracking is important in Pennsylvania.
There are points where she's kind of come around and saying, well, yeah, it's important and I won't stop it. I frankly am still mystified. I'm not sure what her position is because she's embraced both sides.
DS: Okay, let's talk about regulation, mergers and acquisitions within the sector. Thoughts on M&A going forward within the sector? Have we already seen the majority of it? Will it continue? What's your thought?
LS: I think that we have seen the biggest part of it. In talking about regulation, one of the things we saw was this really big delay and hang up this year with all of these mergers.
So, the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, was coming back to these companies and saying, you've got to tell us more. They're really, from my perspective as a Texan and somebody who's in the private markets, really dragging their feet, okay? They did get around to approving the Exxon (XOM) merger.
The Chevron (CVX) is a special deal in this. They've approved that, but there's a Chevron-Exxon thing going on because of the importance of Guyana. And so slowly, sort of in the last month, we have seen approvals of numerous of these big deals.
I will say I checked and the Conoco (COP) -Marathon (MPC), proposed merger is still out there waiting on approval. And yes, I mean, how many $60 billion deals can you do? I think we're done for a little while.
DS: Let's talk about the relationship between OPEC and the rest of the world. Obviously, as we mentioned earlier in the program, the U.S. has become a leading energy producer, which many thought may not have happened.
Maybe you can give us a little bit of context on how we've gotten here and how that kind of shapes the global economy that we're in now.
LS: That's where you have to start by giving all the credit to George Mitchell in fracking because I have this graph that I really like. And it just shows that in – we reached a low point of oil production in 2005, and we were producing 5 million barrels a day.
Now, I understand that we use about 18 or 19 – 17, 18, 19 million barrels a day of oil. And so where does the rest of that oil come from? And at that point, and it was a little bit post 9/11, of course, but we're still pretty dependent on Saudi Arabia and OPEC.
That dependence has shifted to Canada, which is great, but here's the difference. Between 2005 and today, we have turned into actually the world's largest oil producer. We're producing now about 13.2 or 13.3 million barrels a day.
And so if all of a sudden you're producing three quarters of what you want, instead of a quarter, your geopolitical position and your strength is way different. It's much improved.
DS: Before we start talking about individual sectors, industries and stocks that I definitely want to get into, because I think you have some great names to talk about today, we got to talk about nuclear, right?
That whole story, the narrative is – AI is consuming so much power, these chips, the data centers, everything is just taking all this energy in. We need to find new sources.
We had spoken at one point about, I’m in – I live in Georgia, a new nuclear plant opened. Apparently, it was way over budget. Is nuclear the future here, or are we going to go to a European model of small nuclear plants? Are we going to focus on large nuclear plants? What's the shape of that side of the energy sector?
LS: I think that leads into a theme that I want to leave everybody with, which is we've gone from a lot of discussion about energy transition to what I would call instead energy addition. It's the old thing, right? Just because we started using coal, we didn't stop using wood.
There was, I think, this expectation among some people that we would shift completely from a hydrocarbon economy to a non-hydrocarbon economy.
And as the initial graphs show, hydrocarbons form such a big part of our energy use, it's expensive beyond belief for a lot of reasons. Nuclear is attractive. Okay, so we've gone from this concern about strictly emissions Net Zero 50, 2050, all that to reliability and cost and emissions.
So the big appeal for nuclear is its base load. So it's reliable. And that's what these tech guys are looking for with these data centers. And as I said in the open, an AI search uses 10x the electricity of a Google search or browser or normal browser search.
And so suddenly, there's this perceived and I think actual much bigger demand now and in the future. And nuclear is satisfying to the tech companies also because it's non-hydrocarbon. So base load, non-hydrocarbon. Big, expensive to build.
The cute thing has been these companies like NextEra (NEE), NextEra most recently, Constellation (CEG), and then some other companies, going in and restarting these nuclear plants that hadn't closed down only because they were uneconomic.
DS: Yeah, I believe we saw – was it Microsoft (MSFT) that bought Three Mile Island?
LS: Yes.
DS: We've seen a lot of the deals being structured from Amazon (AMZN) and everybody that needs this electricity. And not to mention the electric vehicle and the robots coming down the line and everything else for energy consumption.
Now, Laura, I'd like to transition now. Maybe we can talk about some industries, subclasses of the energy sector that you're really looking forward to after this election period and what's going into 2025. Would you mind sharing some of those?
LS: Let's start with nuclear, for example. Nuclear is great. I have heard an analyst from Veritone say, it's so great and there's so much emphasis on it and really kind of so – it's so long-term. There's an aspect of overhyping. So this is something to kind of be aware of, but I'm very excited to see what develops there.
Now, what other folks, Mobius Risk, what other folks have pointed out is that the nuclear, you get to nuclear, it takes a while. But this need is really immediate. Well, that's the great thing about natural gas, because you can spin up natural gas real fast.
In fact, I would anticipate seeing more demand for natural gas first, if the LNG permitting pause gets lifted, then we can make deals. But particularly, natural gas is great for – natural gas turbines are great for utilities because they back up renewables. So you have to have like 110% backup for renewables, because as we saw with Uri there are just times when the renewables aren't available.
But the other thing is as we're adding the nuclear capacity, which will take a little while even for the restarts, in the meantime, you can put gas units on pretty quick. And gas - it's had a really tough couple of years. It was kind of like all sucked over to Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But in the last few years the price has gone negative, which means you have to pay to take it away in the Permian.
So I know that everything from there seems like an upside with natural gas. With oil and oh so some names on natural gas. I've recently written about Coterra (CTRA). I like them.
I'm excited about the Chesapeake Southwestern combination, which got approved and it's now Expand Energy (EXE) as of a few weeks ago.
There are people who like and don't like Devon (DVN). I'm pretty bullish on them.
And oh, and then I saw something recently about Range Resources (RRC) in Appalachia. There are a bunch of Appalachian producers, gas producers, and they've really kind of taken it on the chin. So I think they may be in for some upside.
DS: So at this moment in time though LNG is still very much investable?
LS: The company I like for LNG is Cheniere (LNG), not the partnership (CQP). They're the biggest, they've been strong sort of throughout. So LNG, it's 12%, 13% of U.S. demand, which is huge.
It's a huge amount. And we had been talking about, if economic doubling that. So with LNG, people need to be aware. Most of those companies are partnerships.
My usual caveat about partnerships think about your tax situation, does it work for you? Because it is more complicated, you've beaten your head on the wall come April 15. But I – that – so Cheniere is a common – they have a common stock at a company aspect, and it is a favorite.
DS: Now, we can't talk about the energy sector without talking about emissions, right?
So carbon capture has definitely become one of the areas of focus that everybody seems to be putting money and investments into for the years ahead.
What are your thoughts on that part of the sector? And do you have any names within that that you might be willing to share?
LS: There are a lot of companies that have recently looked to what is the government willing to pay for? What's the policy preference? And that's one of – the carbon capture is one of the ones that comes up that way.
I think that there are some baseline companies, some big companies like ExxonMobil that are doing these projects.
So that comes to sort of the second point, which is in terms of regulation, just expects a lot of inertia, things aren't going to change overnight, no matter who's elected. And the incentives that are there for carbon capture, I think, will continue to be there.
I have trouble getting excited about carbon capture. It feels like it's been kind of overhyped. It's a sort of a specialty project in the way that renewable diesel has been. It's kind of a luxury market. The joke is what's the biggest carbon capture? It's like a tree. So that's kind of, I guess, buy trees.
DS: Yeah, that's funny. I hear from people all the time, we have a lot of investors and a lot of audience on here on Seeking Alpha that are focused on growth stocks. They want to see what's the best growth company within any sector.
Do you have a name that comes to mind within the energy sector that you're like, this is the best growth name for my next year?
LS: I like the natural gas companies just because they've been beaten up so much.
And I think the natural gas producers, the Coterras, the Expand Energy, those folks. Within electricity, people have glommed onto utilities. There are some excellent sort of all of the above utilities.
They don't have great multiples, but somebody like NextEra, for example, or even (OGE) are pretty good. And then – and maybe some transmission companies like Williams (WMB) or Kinder (KMI).
DS: Laura, I want to ask your thoughts. What are your thoughts about utility companies versus the independent power producer space?
LS: Oh, that is an excellent question. Thank you. Because people sort of – and I used to think they're the same thing and they are not at all. Utility companies, will they answer to a whole lot of people, including their utility commissions? Just heard a utility commissioner talk on a [Veritone] (PH) Podcasts. And there are – the returns are going to be capped.
You can't, as a utility company, come in and say, hey, we want to make a 30% return into – it just won't happen. Independent power producers on the other hand are not constrained in the same way.
I mean, they have to sell the power to somebody, but this is where the spin-off – Constellation was the spin-off from Exelon. And then Vistra had just like, gone to the moon in the last year. And it was because it was like, oh, who has the biggest nuclear fleet in the country, all this interest in nuclear?
Well, that's Constellation. And what did Vistra do? Well, they've got a nuclear facility and then they went out and bought Energy Harbor, which has more nuclear facilities.
So that's independent power producers. I mean they've gone to town, that ship may have sailed, but I do love them.
DS: Let's switch the conversation over to refining. I think we all remember within this last administration. Just a few years ago, we saw prices at the pump for consumers continue to rise.
We saw diesel continue to rise. We saw the trickle into the effect of prices at the grocery store, for example, just getting things through the intermodal side of transportation around the country.
What's going on within the refining space? Is there continuing investment there? Are people still kind of holding steady? What's your take on that?
LS: It’s had a high point in the cycle. Energy is in everything and the cost of transportation is in everything. So from a consumer side and believe it or not from a producer side, it's better if those prices come down.
I mean, the reason I say that from a producer side, ultimately, an oil producer, if the oil price spikes to like $150 and $120 a barrel, it hurts refining, it hurts producers. And it's a spike, it's not stable. Whereas if you have oil at $50 to $70, whatever it will be next year, and you can sort of – you plan and count on that, then it's an input, but it's a known input and it's not driving me crazy.
I think people always are calling for the end of oil sooner than it will happen. It's so vital to transportation, so I do see that continuing to be strong. I'm not sure I answered your question though.
DS: I think you gave us a little bit of direction. Now within the refining space though, is there a specific stock that pops in mind that you're really focused on for this next year?
LS: I think refining - they're in for a slow spot, but it always looks that way in the winter. Refining always looks great in the spring and because winter is a low demand – lower demand point, it always looks worse. That said, I think the refineries are going to come in squeezed and we'll be hearing the next few weeks.
I have always liked Valero (VLO). I liked Marathon. I think they're starting to come to an inflection point. You can't keep giving the company away without growing it. So that's a kind of an issue.
There's some smaller refiners that I'm less enamored of, either not so much because they relied on small refining, but the small refiner exemption, but because they trying to meet the market and the regulatory-induced demand for renewable diesel has spent a lot of money on renewable diesel.
And that market is saturated and t's a little bit like solar, you're kind of dependent on how the price gets set and it's a small market, it's California.
Even California wants to get completely off of hydrocarbons. So I think that's going to come back to bite everybody who has renewable diesel facilities and that is pretty much everybody. So that would be like we've seen it already with Darling and Valero.
DS: Now what about midstream? I don't think we've really talked on that yet. What are you focused on within that part of the energy sector?
LS: The companies, they tend to be consortia that build pipelines, and anybody building a gas pipeline from West Texas to the Gulf Coast, I think, is going to do well. Anybody transporting oil is going to do well.
I will say that in Canada, they've expanded the Canadian to West Coast pipeline. And so some of the oil that would have come down for refiners to use here and to be transported here is instead going on the Canadian pipeline, a Trans Mountain, and going to Asia. So ONEOK (OKE) is a favorite of mine.
DS: I've got a question I've got to ask you. We have a lot of investors on Seeking Alpha that like to follow ETFs. A lot of people are very hype on ETFs, especially because they're, I think, like almost half the market nowadays.
Looking at one of the biggest ones, (XLE), you see such a heavy weighting to Exxon and Chevron, and then kind of more of a standard once you get to ConocoPhillips and down. What are your thoughts on having just those two big producers of energy be so heavily invested within an energy sector ETF?
LS: It sounds like it's kind of a market weighting. I mean, you'll get sort of an energy, I mean, you're clearly getting an energy index reaction. So if it's up – Exxon is not going to go up 30% and Chevron is not going to go up 30% in a given year.
That said, they're very solid, well-run companies. And Exxon, in particular, has been of interest because they're so big that they're able to do this international oil exploration and particularly their Guyana find is really kind of cool.
But that's something big companies can do. The index – the ETF will go up, but it's just going to reflect, you're right, it's going to reflect Exxon and Chevron.
DS: I'm glad you mentioned the international oil exploration. Do you anticipate with how the U.S. has been investing so heavily within the energy sector here that you might see that kind of die down abroad from the U.S. companies, or is it very much still a huge growth opportunity for these companies to go abroad?
LS: The regime, the regulations, country by country are different in who you're dealing with and how the contractual matters and the taxes and all that. And again, particularly offshore exploration is a really big budget project. So there are a lot of companies that just can't do it.
I think we'll see a little bit of pickup. We have seen – I've mentioned Guyana - (APA) has a find in Suriname. I think there's – and certainly, if you're a country that these resources are found offshore, I mean, ideally, it's only good for your citizens.
So, Shale is great. It's fun. It goes really, really fast. And so if I'm a company that anticipates staying in business, I'm going to be looking at other areas.
DS: We're thinking if Harris wins, energy is still going to do well. If Trump wins, energy is still going to do well.
But do you see a difference within areas within energy sector that might benefit if one candidate wins over the other.
I just want to make sure that if we're watching subclasses as to which candidate wins, what do we look for and how do we tailor our portfolios?
LS: I think that if Trump wins, that natural gas is better off, particularly on this LNG permitting, lifting the LNG permitting pause. That's huge. And then Trump more generally for the oil producers, if kind of like we go back to what I would call sort of normal process with offshore leases, that's good.
Also, just generally, if energy prices tend to go up when there's conflict and instability and Trump has really kind of pushed this. We don't want to be at war everywhere, anywhere.
And so if you move in that direction, then there's less of a conflict risk premium for energy and that benefits consumers. And again, ultimately, because spikes are not great for producers. It will benefit producers.
But I will say fracking in Pennsylvania, important.
DS: Thank you so much, Laura. We really appreciate the time. All your insights here today, all the stock names that you picked throughout as well.

 -  XLRE offers real estate exposure for those who shy away from cherry-picking, which is an understandable approach.
 -  Unfortunately, an instrument seemingly aimed to provide diversification benefits, comes with a high holding concentration.
 -  XLRE should be accompanied by solid tailwinds, but I prefer to stick to an active approach.
 -  Please, keep in mind the high concentration aspect to mitigate you overall risk in portfolio.


The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:XLRE) is an interesting option for investors who want exposure to the broad real estate market but avoid cherry-picking. This approach is understandable, as ETFs tend to offer diversification benefits, low costs, and a relatively small amount of time compared to a more active approach.

What Does XLRE Hide Within?

As noted on the State Street (STT) website regarding XLRE:
The fund was formed in 2015, offers quarterly distributions (currently yielding ~3.2%), and involves a 0.09% gross expense ratio. XLRE includes 31 holdings, out of which the Top 10 of them consist of ~60% of the funds' allocation.
That's the main reason I generally prefer cherry-picking over relying on ETFs, especially within the REIT sector, which is pretty intuitive and offers numerous, simple metrics that allow for quick, market-driven benchmarking. Around 60% allocation around Top 10 holdings isn't the portfolio structure I'd like to have (assuming one was to rely solely on XLRE). If one seeks real estate exposure just through XLRE, a 60% concentration on these 10 holdings isn't necessarily the optimal approach either, as:
For instance, XLRE doesn't include some of my top performers and personal favourites, such as:

Long-term Performance Of XLRE Will Be Supported By FED-related Tailwinds

Since mid-2022, when interest rates started rising, the real estate sector struggled, as REITs faced higher costs of financing and a less active transactional market due to the wider disparity between buyers' and sellers' expectations (while buyers faced the higher cost of capital, the sellers upheld their expectations despite the market shift).
However, the situation started to shift with the improving condition of the US economy regarding inflation control, thus supporting the FED's ability to ease their policy. As a result, REITs experienced meaningful recovery, leading XLRE's price higher, but still below pre-tightening levels.
The FED has already cut interest rates by 50 bps in September 2024, and the market expects further cuts even by the end of 2024, aiming for a 100% probability of a 25 bps cut in November and over 80% probability of another 25 bps cut in December.
Why is that important for REITs? There are several factors to consider:

Valuation Outlook and Investment Thesis

Naturally, history is not set to repeat itself, but it often rhymes. REITs have historically outperformed the broad market after FED's tightening cycles. As the FED has (likely) stopped interest rate hikes and is on its way to quantitative easing, REITs are set to benefit. Some upside has already been realised, but I believe there's more to come.
Therefore, I expect XLRE's price to increase in the upcoming quarters. Given the slight pullback, investors are well-positioned to join the ride and capitalize on the upside still left in the real estate tank.
Nevertheless, investors have to be aware of risk factors accompanying XLRE and similar instruments:
To put it frankly, I assign XLRE a 'hold' rating. My main reason is that I'm an active investor within the REIT sector and have succeeded with my 'cherry-picking' approach. For reasons stated earlier, I prefer to stick to cherry-picking, especially within the REIT sector. Nevertheless, XLRE may be considered a 'buy' for investors who definitely shy away from an active approach and seek real estate exposure. That is fine, but please keep in mind the high concentration aspect to mitigate your risk. Thank You!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732410-why-im-getting-more-bullish-on-enbridge,4732410,Why I'm Getting More Bullish On Enbridge,"Summary

 -  Enbridge's growth projects will help support a growing common dividend.
 -  Projects include Mainline expansion, new offshore gas pipelines, and gas and renewable power distribution supporting data center growth.
 -  Series 1 and 5 preferred shares remain good alternatives for more conservative investors.


The Common Shares Are Starting To Outperform

I've been a fan of the US-dollar denominated preferred shares of Enbridge for a few years, specifically the Series 1 (OTC:EBBGF) (TSX:ENB.PR.V:CA) and Series 5 (OTCPK:EBGEF) (TSX:ENB.PF.V:CA). I have not been as bullish on the common shares (NYSE:ENB) (TSX:ENB:CA), considering them in my last article a safe bond substitute, but not much more. While Enbridge has plenty of steady cash flow to support the preferred dividends. The company's growth prospects appeared to be slowing down, which would result in little share price appreciation and low dividend raises for the common shares. As I stated in earlier articles, the US gas utility deals looked barely accretive, with the cost of financing and share dilution offsetting any EBITDA contributions from the acquired businesses. Enbridge also looked to be running out of opportunities to grow business on its Mainline system, which brings crude oil from Alberta to refineries in the Great Lakes area. Finally, the company was branching out into questionable renewable energy projects like European offshore wind.
If we look at a one-year total return chart, we see that Enbridge common stock performed in-line with the Series 1 and 5 preferreds. If you chart it over longer time periods, the preferreds come out looking even better. However, we see that starting in 2Q, the common stock began to do better, starting from a low point to catch up to the preferreds.
Enbridge covered several reasons on their 3Q earnings call to be more optimistic about growth. The company is still interested in growing volumes shipped out of the Alberta oil sands area. Further south, Enbridge is planning to build gas transmission capacity to support new production in the Permian and offshore Gulf Coast. Growth prospects for the recently acquired US gas utilities are already looking better with the growing power demand expected from data centers. This power demand is also creating economic project opportunities in solar with attractive rates of return similar to oil and gas pipelines.
With these added growth projects, I am more confident in Enbridge's capability to get back to a distributable cash flow growth rate of 3% - 5%. This is good for income investors but also supports capital appreciation of the common shares which you would not get from the preferreds. While the Series 1 and 5 preferreds still look attractive, the common shares now join them in Buy territory.

Supporting Growing North American Oil and Gas Production

Since the Line 3 and Line 5 expansion projects got underway, there have not been any Mainline projects in the hopper that Enbridge includes at the end of their quarterly slide deck. However with 3Q results, Enbridge has stated they are once again looking at options to expand oil pipeline capacity out of western Canada. The system is already either full and in apportionment or close to it. Encouragingly, the expansions being discussed involve upgrades of existing assets rather than new lines and new rights-of-way that might receive more pushback from regulators. As discussed by the head of the Liquids Pipelines segment on the call,
On the gas side, Enbridge acquired a stake in a gathering system in the Permian which feeds into the Whistler pipeline which brings gas to LNG facilities on the Gulf Coast. Offshore, Enbridge recently announced a deal with bp (BP) to run pipelines to the Kaskida field in the Gulf. This new system will be sized to handle further production growth, such as from the Tiber field which I discussed in my recent bp article.

Gas Utilities And Renewables To Benefit From Power Demand Growth

As recently as a year ago when Enbridge first announced its acquisition of US gas utilities, growth potential looked limited to population growth and rate base growth from modernization of existing assets. Since then, the magnitude of demand growth from data centers has been better understood. Enbridge estimates an addressable data center demand of 9 GW within their utility footprint. To put that in perspective, that is about half the power as Constellation's (CEG) total nuclear capacity in the PJM region.
The hyperscaler businesses that run data centers want clean (low or no CO2) power and are willing to pay a premium for it. If there is not enough renewable or nuclear power in a region, gas is the next best choice. Nevertheless, renewable power is still highly desired by these customers, creating the opportunity for projects with attractive rates of return, not just for green credibility. As noted on the call,
Enbridge is participating in solar projects in Ohio and Texas with customers like Amazon (AMZN), AT&T (T), and Toyota (TM) already contracted to buy the power output.
With these sources of growth, Enbridge look capable of delivering its planned 3% per year distributable cash flow growth through 2026 and 5% beyond. Since the company conservatively keeps its dividend payout ratio in the range of 60 - 70% of DCF, we should expect dividends to grow at a similar rate.

Series 1 and 5 Preferred Shares Are Still A Good Buy

There are three series of Enbridge preferred shares that trade in US dollars and pay a constant dividend in US dollars for 5 years, then reset to a new rate based on a premium to the 5-year US Treasury Note yield 30 days before the reset date.
There are also 18 series of preferreds that trade and pay dividends in Canadian dollars. As a US shareholder, I cover the 3 USD preferreds due to better liquidity and lack of exchange rate risk. For more details on all there preferreds, please consult the prospectus for each one, which can be found on Enbridge's website.
While I am now feeling better about the growth of the common dividend, the preferred coverage is very strong. All 21 series of preferreds pay out less than $100 million CAD per quarter, compared to operating cash flow of over $2.8 billion CAD.
The preferreds are therefore a great choice for more conservative investors. Of the three USD preferreds, Series 1 and 5 both yield about 0.5% higher than the common shares currently. Series L (OTCPK:EBBNF) only yields about the same as the common shares and resets in 2027, ahead of the other two. For this reason, Series 1 and 5 are the ones I would buy at this time.
The other factor to consider in deciding between the common and the preferred is the future dividend payout. The common dividends are likely to grow each year, at least in CAD terms. The Series 1 and 5 preferred share dividends will be constant until June 2028 for EBBGF and March 2029 for EBGEF. We also don't know what the preferred dividend will be after reset since it is indexed to the 5-year US Treasury yield 30 days before reset. Currently, the 5-year note is yielding 4.22%, which is above where it was the last time the preferreds reset.
Given the projected growth of the common dividend, I estimate the total payout from 2025-2029 will be slightly above what we can expect from the preferreds even if the 5-year Treasury yield does not decline from the current level.
Holding other variables constant, low interest rates should be good and higher rates bad for ENB common share price, similar to any other fixed-rate income investment. With resettable preferreds, however, the share price should be less volatile, especially near the reset date as the market prices in the changes in dividend payout expected after reset.

Risks

Higher interest rates are a risk to the common stock in two ways. First, a high-rate environment increases the supply of high-yielding investments available, some of which may be higher in the capital structure, and less risky than common stock. We saw that a year ago when Enbridge stock bottomed just as the 10-year Treasury was approaching 5%. High yielding common stock prices tend to go down under those conditions to maintain a yield spread over lower risk bonds. Second, Enbridge maintains high debt levels, with net debt/EBITDA around 5. The company regularly refinances debt and sometimes issues new debt for expansions. While Enbridge generates steady operating cash flow due to minimum volume commitments and pricing independent of the commodities being shipped, increasing rates raise the company's interest expense and decrease its operating cash flow.
An unfavorable regulatory environment would also pose a risk for Enbridge. As we saw during the Line 3 and Line 5 projects, local governments and tribes opposed these upgrades even when they would improve the safety and integrity of the pipeline. These entities sometimes even pushed for shutdowns of the existing pipelines. Enbridge was successful in appealing to higher courts, but if sentiment worsens against pipelines and fossil fuels in general in the future, it would impact the company's operations, particularly along the mainline.
Enbridge is also new to working with state utility regulators in the US following its acquisitions this year. While the purchases went smoothly, and these utilities are in historically friendly operating environments, the company could still encounter resistance when pursuing rate increases to support its project plans. This would impact the return on investment of these businesses.
Finally, the common stock dividend is subject to foreign exchange risk for US shareholders as the dividends are declared in Canadian dollars. A weaker Canadian dollar resulted in lower dividends in USD terms in 2022 and 2023 despite small raises in CAD terms.

Conclusion

Enbridge's ""pipeline"" of growth projects looks better than it has in the last few years. Capacity expansion in the mainline and new gas transmission pipelines in the Permian and offshore Gulf benefit from growing upstream activity. The gas utilities as well as renewables benefit from growing data center power consumption. This growth supports Enbridge's plan to grow distributable cash flow 3% annually through 2026 and 5% thereafter. Since the company is careful with dividend coverage, paying out 60 - 70% of DCF, I expect the common stock dividend to grow in line with DCF.
More conservative investors may still consider the Series 1 and Series 5 preferred shares. While dividend coverage is solid, the preferreds carry the risk of the rate resetting every 5 years. The common shares are now attractive despite the lower starting dividend yield because of their higher potential for growth.

 -  Since our initiation on AESI, the company faced a challenging environment coupled with operationnal mistakes.
 -  Yet, despite rising costs and debt, management decided to increase dividend and initiated a $ 200m buyback plan over the upcoming 24 months.
 -  We consider this decision as premature. With high expectations towards the Dune Express project, we prefer to stay away from the stock at this time.
 -  We downgrade our rating to HOLD.


Introduction

On April 26th, we initiated coverage on Atlas Energy Solutions (NYSE:AESI) with a BUY rating. In our view, this company was positioned advantageously with cutting-edge innovation notably through its ''DUNE express'' project.
However, since our initiation, AESI's performance has lagged, with a decline of -14.55%, underperforming the Russell 2000 by 26.7%. This poor performance isn’t unique to AESI. The whole oil and gas industry underperformed. As a matter of fact, the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Index (XOP) also posted a negative return of -15.57%, meaning AESI slightly outperformed the industry by 1%.
In this article, we are going to dive into the company recent earnings print and update our recommendation.

Q3 Earnings Print – Key Numbers

AESI released its Q3 earnings on October 28. The results were mixed, with a 6% top-line growth bringing Q3 2024 revenue to $304 million, nearly meeting consensus expectations. Services accounted for 53% of revenue, while product sales made up the remaining 47%. During this quarter, the company delivered 6 tons of sand at an average price of $24.34 per ton. Despite solid revenue figures, the bottom line disappointed, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.18, missing the expected $0.23. We'll later break down the factors contributing to this miss. AESI, known for its shareholder-friendly policies, announced a $200 million buyback program over the next 24 months and raised its quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.24 per share. We’ll see later why we consider this choice as inappropriate.

A Challenging Environment for the Oil Industry

AESI and other Oil & Gas players face a challenging environment due to multiple factors. The U.S. election and its potential outcome is weighting on investors, with Trump supporting the oil industry and fracking, while Kamala Harris has expressed some opposition. We believe that once the election concludes, this sector and AESI specifically could see a rebound especially if Trump is elected.
The industry is also experiencing significant consolidation, particularly in the U.S. Major deals, such as Diamondback Energy’s (FANG) $26 billion proposition to buy Endeavor Energy in February and ConocoPhillips' (COP) $22.5 billion offer to acquire Marathon Oil in May, highlight this trend.
We think this context puts upstream actors under pressure as larger players seek to streamline operations and reduce costs through economies of scale.
In the near term, we consider this consolidation wave could impact the supply chain, as suppliers might face demand shifts and pricing pressures due to fewer but larger customers.
Additionally, rig-oriented investments are decreasing as seen by the gradual decline in U.S. rig counts.

Operational Hurdles in the Permian Basin

Transforming the Permian basin in a safer and more efficient place can be a route filled with pitfalls. This year has shown how critical it is for AESI to maintain excellence in operations to realize its goal of becoming a revolutionary infrastructure provider.
Since the beginning of the year good things happened and strengthened the company leadership such as the completion of the Kermit plant expansion, the integration of Hi-Crush Inc.
However, the previous quarter has also been a source of many challenges that impacted the firm’s operations. In April, a fire took place at the Kermit facility. Even though it has been mastered quickly, it has damaged the feed system transporting sand from the dryers and separators to storage silos. With such infrastructures, nothing should be left to chance. That’s why management decided to immediately take action in order to improve security and enhance standardization of its processes.
As bad news never come alone, during this quarter, one dredge of the Kermit Facility has also been damaged during the commissioning process. The company decided to take the loss on that specific asset and also took the decision to purchase two new dredges that will be delivered only in 2026.

Operational Setbacks Drive Rising Costs

All these factors required additional investments and expenses aimed at reducing mining costs in the future, impacting the firm’s short-term profitability. This quarter’s operating expenses reached $14.87 per ton of sand produced, driven primarily by the Kermit incident. We expect these costs to normalize going forward. During the Q1 2024 earnings call, management targeted $9 Opex moving into 2025. Given the recent incident, we consider this target unrealistic. However, we expect Opex to trend towards these levels by 2026 with the addition of the new dredges, which should lower the cost per ton of sand.

Financials - Rising Debt and Premature Return to Shareholders Policy

These challenges have impacted the firm’s balance sheet.
Although EBITDA saw a slight decline, the firm’s long-term debt has increased by 2.65 times, now standing at 1.5x EBITDA, a level that remains manageable.
However, this increase in debt has also led to a rise in interest expenses, which now represent 13% of the firm's EBITDA.
Despite the rising debt, management decided to raise quarterly dividend by 5% and allocate $200 million to share buybacks over the next 24 months. Given the events of 2024, this decision does not seem us prudent. We would have preferred management to focus on paying down current liabilities, which now amount to three times the company’s cash reserves.
Nonetheless, the firm’s balance sheet remains solid overall.
The company’s assets provide solid coverage over both its short and long-term obligations.
However, we find the recent capital allocation premature given the rising debt levels.
Ideally, we would have preferred to see the full impact of the DUNE Express launch before taking this decision.
We think that management likely anticipates strong results from the project, but we would have preferred waiting for tangible outcomes to have solid foundation for rewarding shareholders.
While buybacks and dividends can offer immediate value, the increase in debt could introduce financial risk, which could negatively affect long-term shareholder value.
That's why we will monitor these metrics closely, especially given management's acknowledgment that the next quarter and possibly 2025 may be challenging for the industry.

Conclusion

The upcoming months will be critical for AESI, with strong expectations for the DUNE Express launch. Given the incident this quarter, no mistakes will be tolerated. We will follow this launch and the next quarter’s results closely.
However, in light of these high expectations, tough environment facing the energy industry, the firm’s rising debt, and management’s recent capital allocation decision, we are deciding to downgrade AESI to a HOLD rating.
We rather encourage our readers to manage their risks on this position with a possibility to revisit the company investment case once management has proven the effectiveness of its new infrastructure.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732407-golden-ocean-is-picking-up-a-tailwind,4732407,Golden Ocean Is Picking Up A Tailwind,"Summary

 -  Shipping is an essential tool to serve the growing demand for dry bulk commodities: supply chains must be maintained, amid ongoing conflicts and longer routes.
 -  Increased distances and instability risks result in higher shipping costs. Shipping companies with bigger deadweight (dwt) capacity have a competitive edge in that segment.
 -  Golden Ocean is strategically well-positioned in the business of higher dwt vessels, where competition is low: a further penetration in this segment could boost its growth and dividends.
 -  The current price doesn’t reflect its strengths. My buy-target is in the $13.6-$15.8 range.
 -  I used a DDM model to represent potential of the company to distribute interesting dividends in the future.


If your investment goals include selecting stocks that pay dividends and operate in traditional sectors, Golden Ocean (NASDAQ:GOGL) could be a good pick. Here’s why: The company is among the leaders in the dry bulk sector and is known for its high dividend yield, thanks to its ability to generate profits and cash flow over time. The new global landscape puts Golden Ocean in a favorable position compared to its competitors. In a geopolitical context characterized by significant uncertainty and an ever-increasing demand for raw materials, Golden Ocean can ensure the transport of large quantities of commodities over long routes, thanks to its fleet composed of large vessels. Its positioning, featuring sizable ships, makes it almost unique in its field. The current price does not reflect this strength. I used a DDM model that places the stock price in the $13.6-$15.8 range and takes into account the company's untapped potential to generate increasing dividends in the coming years.

Dry bulk shipping demand

In today’s world, three fundamental needs consistently stand out for people everywhere: food, shelter, and technology.
Maritime transportation stands out as a vital tool for meeting those needs and dry bulk shipping plays a crucial role in fulfilling a demand that is expected to grow at a remarkable pace in the very next years. The tables below depict bulk goods market forecast.
Table 1: Iron Ore Market – Values and CAGR
Table 2: Global Coal Market – Values and CAGR
Table 3: electricity production by source, World
Table 4: Global Fertilizers Market – Values and CAGR
Table 5: Global Grain Market – Values and CAGR
Given the above picture, a continuous increase in bulk shipping doesn’t come as a surprise, with total demand growth for 2024 expected to land at 4-5% and break through 180m Twenty (foot) Equivalent Unit (TEU), with container volumes higher than ever. While 2024 has been characterized by cargo frontloading to safeguard inventory levels in war winds, 2025 is expected to grow at 3%.
Table 6: Global Container Volumes

Bulk shipping supply

According to Marine Digital, today 10 companies dominate the international bulk shipping market. At first glance, two of them appear to have quite similar volumes, business models, financial KPIs:
Table 7: Business Details – Star Bulk vs. Golden Ocean Group
In 2024 the two rivals represented more than 60% of their peer market in terms of dwt:
Table 8: Golden Ocean fleet composition versus its main competitors
Golden Ocean has a unique positioning in that market. The company defines itself as “The Leading Owner in Large-Sized Dry Bulk”, with three main strengths:
In fact, Golden Ocean presents some peculiarities that could positively impact its growth perspectives:
1. Fleet composition. The Company fleet is mainly composed of “Capesize Vessels”, the largest in terms of dimensions and capacity. Capesize (Baby Cape, Cape, Newcastlemax, Ultra Cape) are too big to go through the Panama canal. They are mostly used in iron ore and coal traffic. Their name is derived from their suitability for navigating around capes. In fact, Golden Ocean employs them for longer routes that often go past the Cape of Good Hope.
Table 9: Main vessel types
2. Growth model. Companies in the sector have grown and may be growing thanks to acquisitions. This may imply the risk of not being able to integrate different realities. Golden Ocean seems instead more focused on its fleet renewal to meet its expansion objectives, by relying on internal growth and cost efficiency
3. Revenue mix. The dry bulk market is mainly composed of two different offers: time charter agreements and voyage charter agreements. Under a time charter agreement, a vessel is contracted for a specific period of time and a specified daily fixed or index-linked charter hire rate. Under a voyage charter agreement, a contract is signed in the spot market for the use of a vessel for a specific voyage to transport a specified cargo at an agreed per unit freight or occasionally as a lump sum. Golden Ocean uses a quite balanced mix in its offer, though slightly skewed towards voyage charters. This is also consistent with its high dwt vessels, suitable for long distances and longer time, not convenient for a buyer entering a time charter agreement. In time charter contracts the charterer must pay for fuel and supply costs, as well as the cost of cargo operations and port charges, as the ship owner is simply leasing the vessel to the charterer. On the contrary, in voyage charter agreements the ship owner is tasked with delivering the cargo and paying for all costs related to that obligation. To make the two types of contract comparable, a KPI is commonly used in the sector. That is a non-GAP measure and it’s known as Time Charter Equivalent (TCE). TCE is generally calculated by subtracting voyage expenses from voyage revenue and dividing the net amount (time charter equivalent revenues) by the number of days in the period.
Table 10: Golden Ocean Revenue composition
Table 11: Golden Ocean Time Charter Equivalent Income and TCE
4. Investments. For Golden Ocean, investments are essentially related to fleet renewal. It’s not a case that at the end of FY2023 the average vessel age was about 7.3 years (quite low in comparison with rivals)
5. Environmental requirements. Golden Ocean fleet lower age implies that the company is up-to-speed on compliances like ballast water discharge regulations, having no vessels constructed before September 8, 2017 (that generally miss on-board systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms).

Company valuation: main assumptions

The Company is well equipped to create value in the future, based on several assumptions:
Information and financial data on Golden Ocean reveal that:
Table 12: Golden Ocean Net Income, Dividends and Cash Flow
2. Its income and cash results are improving in time, despite one exception only, in 2023
3. It plays in a risky environment, subject to raw materials market volatility and war winds. This may generate opportunities as well, as in the case of increasing raw materials demand, emerging market catch-up effect, new routes required to circumnavigate dangerous battlefields
4. It is well-stocked in terms of vessel dimension and age: its revenue growth is essentially related to modern fleet investments. This in turn implies that Golden Ocean isn’t in a hurry to acquire other companies and make the subsequent (and not efficient) effort to integrate them.

Company valuation model

Based on the above:
TABLE 13: Dry Bulk Shipping Market, Size by Vessel Type, 2022-2032 ($B)
2. This in turn may translate into higher TCE for Golden Ocean. In 2021, thanks to an increasing post-covid demand and high impact of voyage charter revenues, the company TCE peaked $27,582 for FY2021. Q2 2024 YTD data reveal that the company has dramatically improved its TCE rate in the latest months. With its recognized long-haul positioning, the company could easily come back to 2021 TCE rates. While it’s true that TCE rates bottomed in October, after September peak and many believe the market is severely impacted by China slowdown, a volatile demand in the Capesize segment could represent an upside potential for Golden Ocean, as Q2 2024 company financial results seem to prove.
TABLE 14: Dry Bulk Spot Rates - YTD
In addition, the significant focus of forecasters on China relenting economy and its impact on dry bulk business risk ignoring part of the story. In fact, a fresh and dynamic trend could come from the huge electricity demand expected for the very next year. That trend is mainly the result of AI sector dramatic growth. Datacenters are essential tools for AI deployment. They are hungry for energy and make a significant impact on global energy consumption. This would imply the need to feel the gap between electricity supply and demand, by recurring to new plants (including nuclear reactors), power grid equipment, renewable energy production. The use and transportation of several raw materials will be essential to meet those requirements.

3. Despite relevant fixed capital and depreciation, other costs are more volume-sensitive: growing revenues are expected to translate into higher net income figures. In addition, the lower fleet age could have a positive impact by translating into lower environmental compliance costs
4. The high-dividend yield history of Golden Ocean is expected to be preserved, considering that even in 2023, when results were disappointing, the company distributed a dividend that encompassed income. In my model I projected a DPS/EPS ratio of 0.89, in line with 2023 dividend distribution and more prudential than 2024
Table 17: Golden Ocean Dividend Yield History
All that said, a DDM model seems appropriate to depict the company valuation.
In fact:
My analysis has been developed on a 3-year dividend forecast, with a terminal value based on a dividend multiple in the 8x-10x range, based on the company dividend yield history.
I expect the price to be in the $13.6-$15.8, making a buy recommendation appropriate.

Risks

An economic slowdown may negatively impact the demand for raw materials and thus generate a domino effect in the dry bulk market. This is especially true in the long-haul business, which is more volatile in terms of both volumes and prices.
Should this happen, a contraction in revenues and TCE may not only impact Golden Ocean's profits and operating cash flows but also its ability to maintain a high dividend policy.
In addition, investments in large vessels may negatively affect its cost structure, resulting in a higher expense percentage and greater reliance on debt.
The significant escalation of geopolitical tensions would also impact Golden Ocean more than its competitors. Its substantial presence in the voyage business may, in fact, translate into higher voyage expenses, from insurance to fuel costs to cargo losses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732406-weg-q3-there-is-no-room-for-modest-results,4732406,WEG Q3: There Is No Room For Modest Results,"Summary

 -  WEG reported decent results in 3Q24, with revenues growing modestly, driven by international performance and exchange rate variation.
 -  The company's margins were stable in the quarter, amid the integration of Regal Rexnord assets, which increased SG&A expenses.
 -  Although the result was not bad, the company has a stretched valuation and more is expected from WEG to justify this valuation.


Investment Thesis

I recommend holding WEG shares after the 3Q24 earnings release. It is worth noting that this article is a continuation of my coverage initiation thesis, published on April 3rd, and updated with each earnings release.
WEG is a Brazilian multinational in the capital goods segment. In 3Q24, the company reported decent results, with modest revenue growth and maintenance of margins. However, we will see that the company's valuation does not allow for modest results.

WEG 3Q24 Results Review

WEG released its 3Q24 results on October 30, and as we can see below, they came in below market expectations in both net revenue and earnings per share, which is not in line with the company's history of surprising the market.
Below, I will provide a complete analysis of each segment of the company's results in 3Q24. It is important to note that the company releases its results in BRL, and I will convert them to dollars using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 5.43 BRL, as this was the exchange rate on the last day of the quarter.

Revenues - Weak Brazil, Strong International

WEG reported a +6.3% q/q and +22.1% y/y variation in net revenue to BRL 9.86 billion ($1.81 billion). The foreign market had an annual increase of 23.8% due to the assets incorporated by Regal Rexnord, were it not for them, revenue would have grown 14.2%. In the local market, performance was weak, with annual growth of only 1.5%.
Honestly, given WEG's valuation, even the 14% organic growth in international revenues left me dissatisfied. In the local market, however, performance was poor due to macroeconomic difficulties. I expected more growth.

Margins - Light Compression

WEG reported a gross margin variation of +80 bps q/q and +21 bps y/y, reaching 34.5%. The EBITDA margin had a slight quarterly retraction of 30 bps, reaching 22.6%, as we can see below. The reasons were the integration with Regal Rexnord assets and increased SG&A expenses.
WEG indicates that margins should remain at these levels in the medium term, however, it is starting to become clear (at least to me) that the incorporation of Regal Rexnord's assets will indeed have an impact on margins, and WEG's current valuation does not allow for any complications.

Net Income - Light Compression

The company ended the quarter with BRL 3.1 billion ($572 million) in net cash, and had tax rate benefits due to the higher contribution of revenues from abroad. Thus, net income varied by +9.5% q/q and +20.4% y/y.
WEG presented a decent result. Basically, the company benefited greatly from the depreciation of the real and the integration of assets to increase its revenues, and its margins remained stable. But what are the prospects?
In my view, with the increase in interest rates in Brazil, the domestic market will continue to be less powerful than the international market. However, the depreciation levels of the real seem temporary to me, which could undermine the growth of WEG's international revenues in the next results.
But what worries me most is the company's growth level, given its valuation. As we have seen, the company's revenues grew only 1.5% annually in the local market, and would have grown 14% in the international market if it were not for the acquisition of assets, and the current valuation does not allow for this, as we will see below.

Valuation - Light Compression

To evaluate the company, I will use the comparative evaluation method with the EV/EBITDA multiple, to eliminate the distortions that the financial result and taxes can create, since we will compare the company against global peers.
As we can see, although WEG has a slightly higher EBITDA margin than its peers, its valuation is significantly higher. If we take the average EV/EBITDA of the sector, we arrive at 19.5x EBITDA, not allowing any buy recommendation despite the quality of the company.
This corroborates the recommendation to hold and wait for a better opportunity. Additionally, I feel quite reassured about the recommendation when I see that Seeking Alpha's Quant tools also make the same recommendation.

Potential Threats To The Thesis

As threats to my thesis, it is worth remembering that in recent years, WEG has consistently traded at a premium to its international peers, so it is difficult to believe that it will trade at the sector's average EV/EBITDA.
Additionally, WEG is considered a ""safe haven"" among Brazilian stocks. It is a company that tends to appreciate in adverse macroeconomic periods such as the one Brazil is experiencing, as this scenario tends to make local investors buy the company's shares to protect themselves.
The thesis is complex, especially since the company has global business and is logically exposed to several geographies. Investors should exercise caution when conducting their investment analysis.

The Bottom Line

WEG reported decent results in my view, showing modest revenue growth while maintaining margins. Exchange rate fluctuations and significant exposure to international business mitigated the risks of a more hostile macroeconomic scenario in Brazil.
However, with a 38% premium to the average valuation of its peers, the company delivered little growth in my view. One example was the annual organic revenue growth of only 1.5% in Brazil and 14% abroad.
Based on this analysis, I recommend holding WEG (NYSE:WEGZY) shares. In my view, investors should wait for more attractive prices before buying the company's shares, even though the quality of its executives is unquestionable.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732314-meta-stock-ai-train-isnt-slowing-down-anytime-soon,4732314,Meta: AI Train Isn't Slowing Down Anytime Soon,"Summary

 -  Meta investors who trust Mark Zuckerberg have been rewarded as the stock outperformed the market significantly over the past year.
 -  The market likely understated Meta's ability to embed AI and drive growth in its core business previously.
 -  Zuckerberg has upped the ante against its big tech peers, as AI CapEx is expected to surge through 2025.
 -  META's valuation isn't expensive when adjusted for its growth prospects.
 -  I argue why AI growth investors should consider META's recent pullback as a solid buying opportunity.
 -  I am JR research, an opportunistic investor who identifies attractive risk/reward opportunities supported by robust price action to potentially generate alpha well above the S&P 500. I run the investing group Ultimate Growth Investing.


Meta: Outperformance Isn't A Fluke

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) investors who remained on the Mark Zuckerberg train saw the stock power to new highs in October 2024. As a result, META has significantly outperformed the market over the past year, delivering a total return of more than 80%. It has also beaten Google's (GOOGL) (GOOG) one-year return, as the Mountain View-headquartered company struggled with convincing the market about the superiority of its Gemini AI models while facing regulatory challenges.
In my previous bullish META article, I urged investors to stay on board even though the stock is no longer assessed as undervalued. The Menlo Park-headquartered company has demonstrated its ability to infuse AI into its core business while lifting engagement in its new growth optionalities (Threads, Reels, WhatsApp).
Therefore, I'm not unduly concerned with META's pullback from its highs in October 2024 as the market navigates some near-term concerns about its ability to monetize AI while lifting CapEx to new heights through 2025. There's little doubt that Meta's AI data center infrastructure is highly competitive, allowing it to take on the best AI companies in the market. CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized Meta's AI clusters are more significant than what was reported as leading in the market. He highlighted:
Therefore, Meta has upped the ante in training its open-source Llama LLM, iterating and evolving its technological advantage predicated on its market-leading AI infrastructure. Notwithstanding Zuckerberg's enthusiasm, the stock's pullback this week suggests the market could be concerned about the potential impact on Meta's forward operating margins.

Meta's Ability To Embed AI Remains Robust

Meta's year of efficiency in 2023 has given way to a surging CapEx growth forecast through 2026. Wall Street analysts have dialed up their estimates to reflect the company's enthusiasm and ability to compete with the other hyperscalers. Meta CFO Susan Li followed through her commentary on her boss's optimism, telegraphing a 2024 CapEx outlook of between $38B and $40B. Furthermore, Li added more color to her CapEx commentary, enunciating that Meta anticipates ""significant capital expenditure growth in 2025."" Therefore, it has also elevated the market sentiments on Nvidia (NVDA) stock as it surged to its October 2024 highs, corroborating that the AI infrastructure investment thesis isn't slowing down anytime soon.
Less bullish or bearish investors on META's thesis might contend with the company's lack of a cloud computing business model. Hence, Meta must ensure AI monetization within its core digital advertising business model, potentially affecting its operating profitability.
While the concerns are justified, Meta has demonstrated its ability to continue lifting its near-term margins. In Meta's Q3 report, the company delivered a 26% YoY increase in operating income, representing an operating margin of 42.7%. It's a marked improvement over last year's 40.3% metric, underscoring the company's ability to embed AI.
However, Zuckerberg's caution that AI might not accrue significant profits in the near term could have ruffled some feathers and raised concerns about its AI CapEx spending. However, Meta's encouraging progress in Reels and WhatsApp should mitigate the CapEx growth risks as the company competes with its peers on the leading edge of AI developments. Furthermore, Meta reported a robust adoption of its Llama AI model, accruing over 500M monthly active users across its ecosystem. Therefore, I'm confident the company can maintain robust profitability over the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.

Meta's Long-Term Growth Optionalities With AI

In addition, Meta's ability to drive ad impressions (up 7% YoY) while delivering an 11% increase in average price per ad has bolstered its monetization potential. Meta's Q4 revenue outlook suggests a growth deceleration (16% YoY increase) against Q3's 19% growth.
However, investors should remain focused on Meta's AI monetization thesis and the potential uplift to its operating profitability over time. Wall Street's estimates on Meta's revenue and adjusted earnings have also been upgraded, underpinning my bullish proposition.
META's ""D-"" valuation grade suggests it's no longer undervalued. However, investors should assess it as a growth stock (""B+"" growth grade) when comparing it against its communications sector (XLC) peers. META's forward adjusted PEG ratio of 1.18 remains markedly below its sector median of 1.44, justifying its solid buying sentiments (""A"" momentum grade). Hence, I assess that investors are expected to support dip-buying opportunities on META, given its long-term AI growth optionalities.
Despite that, investors must still cautiously assess META's digital advertising thesis. Meta's exposure to small and medium-sized advertisers in its ecosystem could expose it to the vagaries of the economy, particularly in a hard-landing scenario. Although it isn't my base case, Meta's lack of a solid cloud computing hyperscaler business could hinder a more robust valuation re-rating.
In addition, META's losses with its Reality Labs business are not expected to slow down, as the company seeks to overcome its ecosystem disadvantage by establishing its own ""walled garden."" Meta's ability to invest could be hindered by the cyclicality of its core digital advertising model, potentially worsened by its more aggressive AI infrastructure investment.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730151-my-top-pick-for-2025-international-workplace-group,4730151,My Top Pick For 2025: International Workplace Group,"Summary

 -  International Workplace Group plc is a close peer of WeWork but far bigger.
 -  Its recent shift to a capital-light business model has massive potential.
 -  Yet, IWGFF is today priced at an incredibly low valuation, offering significant upside potential for investors in the coming years.
 -  I am Jussi Askola, President of Leonberg Capital, a boutique investment firm that specializes in REIT investing. I lead the investing group High Yield Landlord where I share my real-money REIT portfolio and transactions in real-time.


Minimizing losses is just as crucial as securing wins. Although we've experienced our share of setbacks, I am glad that we resisted the temptation to invest in office REITs recently. Despite many advocating for them as value investments, we chose a more cautious path.
For context, I had already been running my small investment firm fully remotely for years before the pandemic, and hybrid/remote work settings have been very common where I come from (Finland) for a long time.
Full remote work is certainly not for everyone and has its set of challenges, but hybrid work is really a no-brainer in most cases, as it helps to:


But unfortunately for landlords, this means that tenants would need to reconfigure their office footprint. They likely lease less of it, and possibly move to different buildings, leading to less demand, lower occupancy rates, dropping rents, higher leasing incentives, tenant improvements, and significantly higher capex.
All of this has come true with vacancy rates rising to the highest level ever recorded at 20%:


Moreover, things could get even worse because a lot of office buildings still have years left on their leases. As they gradually expire, many will not renew and tenants will be in a stronger position than ever to negotiate for lower rents and higher incentives. Vacancy rates are expected to rise to 24% by 2026 according to Moody's director of commercial real estate.
This brings me to today's opportunity, which is one of my Top Picks for 2025.
International Workplace Group plc (IWG.L, OTCPK:IWGFF) stands to benefit from this mess, but the market has not recognized it yet. It is the leading provider of co-working space, even bigger than WeWork (OTC:WEWKQ / WEWKG), owning many brands including Regus, HQ, and Spaces. I regularly use their co-working space, especially when I am traveling.
We think that its stock has become incredibly cheap as its business recovered from the pandemic, and we believe that it is now at an inflection point with several catalysts in the near term.
Ultimately, we expect that it has the potential to become a multi-bagger in the coming years as its cash flow rises at a rapid pace and its valuation multiple expands at the same time.
For this reason, we recently initiated a medium-size position for our Core Portfolio.
Here are three quick notes before we go into the investment thesis:
1) IWG is not a REIT or a traditional real estate investment. It is a service provider to the real estate sector. However, I would note that its earnings are still very much tied to the performance of its properties. Even in cases in which it does not own the building, it typically has it under a long-term lease and/or it earns a royalty for its management under a long-term agreement. Similarly, some REITs like Outfront Media (OUT) do not always own the land. They lease it instead on a long-term basis and simply operate the billboard on it. I would also add that many active REIT asset managers like Land & Buildings regularly invest in such companies as part of their strategy. They currently own a big position in CBRE Group (CBRE), for instance. IWG is our choice for such exposure.
2) Its yield is very low today, and this is why I haven't included it in our Portfolio at High Yield Landlord so far. However, my company has owned a large position in it for a while and I have recently accumulated a lot more of it. I finally decided to invest in it as part of our Core Portfolio because we expect the company to start returning significantly more capital to shareholders in 2025 once it is done deleveraging. Moreover, what ultimately matters is the average yield of the portfolio, and including this one position won't change it meaningfully.
3) Right now, it is primarily listed in the UK, but note that its biggest market is the US and the company recently changed its reporting currency to the US Dollar. It is also expected to shift to US GAAP accounting, and it could move its primary listing to the US in the near term. This is why we included it in our Core Portfolio instead of our International Portfolio. More on this below.

IWG: Going From a Capital-Intensive to Capital-Light Business Model

Until recently, IWG's business consisted of finding vacant office space, signing a long-term lease, and then heavily investing in upgrades, furniture, and marketing to turn it into a cash flowing co-working space.
It would then use the cash flow from existing properties to invest in new ones.
That's primarily how it grew from its first location in 1989 to ~3,751 today:


This makes it the global leader, with its next biggest rival, WeWork, only managing 582 locations, and they recently went through bankruptcy due to severe mismanagement.
IWG provides flexible office space to the biggest companies in over 120 different countries:


This legacy business is attractive, but it isn't expectational. Its scale is a major competitive advantage, as these giant multinational companies can tap into IWG's massive network of office buildings with great flexibility and often at a much lower cost than if they leased individual buildings themselves.
But now comes the interesting part.
This was a capital-intensive business for most of IWG's existence, means that it had to always invest its own capital to open new locations. This slowed down its growth potential, and it also increased risks because of the greater operational leverage of this model, and the requirements to commit for long-term leases.
But the pandemic brought a rapid shift to hybrid work, and it is now expected that 30% of office space will be flexible by the end of this decade, bringing enormous growth to the sector.
Office landlords are desperate to fill vacant space and flexible office space is a great solution.
But they don't have the skills, network, scale, system, or brands to easily convert their buildings into flexible space, and IWG is here to help with that.
It is now partnering with building owners and that's how its business is turning into a capital-light model that's similar to what Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR) are for hotels:


The landlord provides the building and invests all the capital to convert the space. IWG then provides the brand, the scale, booking systems, etc. and takes care of the management in exchange for a 16% royalty of the revenue.
It is a win-win solution for both.
The landlords get to turn their empty building into a cash flowing property. IWG accelerates its growth and increases the quality of its business because this model enjoys high-margin, low operational leverage, no lease commitments, and it is capital light, which will supercharge their growth.
IWG pivoted to this model in late 2022 and the momentum in signing managed partners has been incredible. The signed 839 new deals in 2023, and they expect to do closer to 1,000 this year, and even more in 2025.
This pace is crazy when you compare it to the company's 3,751 locations.
It means that in just a few years from now, IWG will have more than doubled its portfolio size, and it will be increasingly titled towards capital-light assets, which deserve a materially higher multiple (lower operational leverage, higher ROIC, faster growth, etc.).
But the market isn't seeing this pivot just yet because it is not yet reflected in its results. It takes about 10 months to open new locations and another 18 months to hit revenue maturity. Currently, the managed division is not contributing any significant cash flow to the company. However, that will change soon and that's how the company is guiding to grow its EBITDA from $403 million in 2023 to $1 billion in the “medium term,” presumably 3–4 years from now:


Uzo Capital created a nice model and its takeaways are that the shares are today priced at 7x its 2025 FCF and that the company should be in a position to grow its FCF per share by up to 40% annually from 2025 to 2028.
I recommend that you read his article by clicking here.
I think that his assumptions are a bit aggressive, but in any case, this is ultra-cheap for the leader of a rapidly growing sector with significant competitive advantages. Hilton and Marriott commonly trade at about 3x higher FCF multiples despite growing much slower and facing arguably greater risks, operating in a highly competitive sector with weaker competitive advantages.
Why is it so cheap then?
Too much leverage? No. They expect to reach their 1x Debt / EBITDA target by the end of this year.
Poor management? Again no. The company's founder and CEO Mark Dixon still owns 25% of the equity, and he acts in the best interest of shareholders.
Rather, it appears that the valuation is discounted because the company is associated with the office sector, which is hated, and WeWork, which recently went bankrupt due to its mismanagement.
To be clear, this doesn't mean that there aren't risks (we discuss those later), but it appears that the primary reason for why discounting IWG so heavily is unwarranted.
If it doubles its cash flow and its multiple, it could trade 4x higher in 2026.
Even if you think that they only get half of that, it is a 2x by then.
Best of all, there are strong catalysts to force this upside realization:
The primary one is the growth of its managed business. It will not only lead to rapid cash flow growth, but it will also improve the quality of the business, which will justify a higher valuation multiple.
Secondly, they recently moved their reporting to the US dollar, and they are expected to shift their accounting to US GAAP in the near term, and a US listing could follow shortly after. Plenty of investors are not looking at IWG simply because they are listed in the UK, but this could change soon.
Thirdly, there are buybacks. The management has emphasized that once they are down deleveraging and reach their 1x Debt-to-EBITDA target, they will turn their focus to returning more capital to shareholders. The most tax-efficient way to do that is via buybacks, and we know that the CEO cares a lot about tax-efficiency given that he structured IWG in Jersey and he himself lives in Monaco.
Fourth, before the pandemic, IWG was in the process of selling its owned facilities to franchisees. It already sold its business in Japan in 2019 to a franchisee for $446 million, plus recurring franchise fees going forward. Shortly after, they also sold their business in Taiwan, Switzerland, Monaco, and in Gibraltar and indicated that they would do it for the entire company to unlock value and become a capital-light business for the most part. But this process was disrupted by the pandemic because it caused their margins to drop significantly, making the business less viable for franchisees.
Before the pandemic, the margins of its locations were at around 25%, which was high enough for franchisees to pay a cut to IWG and still earn a good return. But these margins dipped during the crisis. They recovered to 15.8% in 2022 and 20.4% in 2023. As they get back to their normalized levels, IWG could return to selling owned assets to franchisees.
Fifth, IWG also owns the biggest digital marketplace for flexible workspace. It is an independent company called Worka, and it is the equivalent of Airbnb for flexible office. It was rumored in late 2022 that the private equity company, CVC, had approached IWG to acquire this asset for $1.72 billion, and it has grown further since then. The company's market cap is today right around $2.3 billion, so this is very significant. The company's founder has previously stated that this asset is deeply undervalued by the market. Given that they have kept it as an independent company with its own board, we think that an eventual spin-off or sale is quite likely.
Finally, the company's founder and CEO Mark Dixon still owns 25% of the company, he is a self-made billionaire, and he is now 63 years old. He previously was approached by Brookfield, which offered it $3.2 billion to buy the entire company in 2018, but Mark declined the offer. He stated that it undervalued its future prospects, but eventually, Mark will likely want an exit, especially if the market fails to value the company correctly.
Ultimately, we think there are plenty of levers to pull here for value to be unlocked. The upside could be very significant in the coming years, given the rapid growth prospects and the low multiple that we are paying for it.
If a recession were to hit, its business would suffer because it is moderately cyclical, although the shift to flexible office space wouldn't end and could even accelerate as a result of a recession. It would likely be a case of short-term pain for long-term gain.
There is also the risk that the company grows too fast and the managed locations underperform, resulting in bad publicity among property owners, which would likely slow down its future growth.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732403-nl-industries-low-growth-limited-upside,4732403,"NL Industries: Low Growth, Limited Upside","Summary

 -  NL Industries is a holding company that has ownerships stakes in low-growth, average businesses that are trading at relatively high P/Es.
 -  The upside and downside are both limited, as the valuation limits upside, yet the strong balance sheet protects the downside.
 -  Kronos is pulling more of the weight and is likely to be the main contributor to the top-line.
 -  Shares are a hold with a price target of $8.


Investment Thesis

NL Industries (NYSE:NL) is a low-growth, decent dividend yielding stock that has reached its peak. I think investors would be better served looking elsewhere right now, as $8 per share is likely the highest it will go. While the upside is limited, so is the downside, as the holding company has a strong balance sheet and flush with cash. Therefore, I expect the stock to trade sideways and hover around $8 per share, so existing investors may want to rotate out of the stock and find something else to buy.

Company Overview

NL Industries is a holding company that operates in the components industry and the chemicals industry, with their majority-owned subsidiary CompX International (NYSE:CIX) and Kronos (NYSE:KRO) respectively. According to their 10-K, they have a 87% ownership stake in CompX International and a 31% stake in Kronos.
CompX International ""manufactures mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in postal, recreational transportation, office and institutional furniture, cabinetry, tool storage and healthcare applications"" according to the annual report. They also make other components used in ""recreational marine and other industries"". This business has proven to be a relatively steady earner, with reasonably consistent sales and profits over the business and economic cycle.
NL Industries also owns a minority stake in Kronos, a ""leading global producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments"". Titanium dioxide pigments are used in ""coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals"". Compared to CompX, this business is has lower margins and but also has relatively steady sales.
What makes NL Industries appealing is that it has the right mix between these two companies to make a diversified, stable source of revenue that offers decent dividends to income investors. This holding company is a low-growth sort of business, and at today's 10x forward P/E ratio the stock is reasonably cheap compared to its sector median.
The balance sheet is quite strong, with a net cash position of $178.9 million as of the last quarterly report according to Seeking Alpha. I believe this is a stable holding company that can grow book value in the mid-single high digits, similar to its past. Both businesses that NL Industries owns seem to have decent pricing power, as they were able to maintain sales despite rising inflation over the past few years. Overall, I rate the business as average but suggest that shares are already fairly valued at around $8 per share.

CompX International Has Growth Challenges

CompX, a major holding of NL Industries, is facing some obsolescence risk due to the shift away from physical storage of information to the digital realm. Many of their mechanical cabinet locks have limited use cases in today's digital world, so it's no surprise that recent Q2 numbers were unexciting. Going forward, I expect CompX to be a no-grower and face growth challenges as their industry faces a potential slow, secular decline.
According to CompX's recent Q2 numbers, sales dipped a little,
I expect this slow decline to continue in the near term, as many of CompX's products are used in industries that are facing secular growth challenges. Industries such as filing cabinets, lockers, mailboxes, and retail displays are being replaced by their digital equivalent. What this means for investors in NL Industries and CompX, is that the top-line is difficult to grow and is more prone to decline.
Furthermore, the shift to EVs has made traditional gas tanks, fuel dispensers, and some ignition components in less demand. It's hard to grow when the industry CompX operates in is facing intense competition and secular growth challenges. At 17x TTM earnings according to Seeking Alpha, CompX trades pretty expensive given its growth prospects and puts NL industries' stock at risk, as it owns a substantial stake in CompX.

Kronos Picks Up Its Weight

Kronos reported Q2 earnings number recently, with pretty decent growth despite missing analyst estimates,
Kronos looks to me a better suited for growth than CompX, judging from improving demand and the increase in production volumes. Their titanium dioxide pigments are used in housing, manufacturing, and industrial applications. Seeking Alpha estimates revenue to hit new highs of over $2 billion for 2024 and 2025, suggesting that Kronos is picking up its weight and the real driver of growth for NL Industries.
However, the one negative indicator is the decline in average TiO2 selling prices, which indicates that the higher sales is mostly due to higher production volumes, not an increase in sales price. This could lead to future profitability challenges for Kronos, as the market demand for titanium dioxide can be cyclical.
Overall, Kronos appears to be a low gross margin, cyclical business that is temporarily experiencing a upswing currently in fundamentals. At a FWD P/E ratio of 16x according to Seeking Alpha, Kronos appears to be relatively expensive and may experience a downward correction in its stock. In conclusion, my analysis of both CompX and Kronos suggest that the businesses are low-growth and expensive.

Valuation - $8 Fair Value

I think at today's forward P/E of 10x, the stock is appropriately priced. Both of NL Industries' holdings are low-growth, stable businesses with pretty high P/Es relative to their industry. I don't see much more upside for NL Industries, and see secular growth challenges for CompX. Kronos has far too low gross margins right now, sitting at around 20% at the time of writing. Although improved from a bottom in 2023, I see Kronos having a hard time making significant profit as its cost profile is rather high.
Therefore, the forward P/E of 10x is consistent with the 5Y average of 9x, leading me to believe the shares are fairly valued. Investors may choose to exit if they find better opportunities, and new investors are advised to stay away for now. Both of these companies to me are average, low-growth businesses that do not seem to have sustainable competitive advantages. Thus, the profit multiple NL deserves should be modest at best.
Cash flow from operations has been a positive signal that the dividend is well covered, and the strong balance sheet with an increasing cash balance suggests that although the upside is limited, so is the downside. Therefore, investors should expect the stock to trade flat as the overall holding company has rather unexciting fundamentals.

Risks

Kronos is a cyclical company, that is mostly impacted by the selling price of titanium dioxide. In the annual report, they say, ""Pricing within the global TiO2 industry over the long term is cyclical and changes in economic conditions worldwide can significantly impact Kronos’ earnings and operating cash flows"". Kronos experience a cyclical downturn which than negatively impact its financials, and spills over to a decline in NL Industries' stock.
CompX's products are intensely competitive and mostly a commodity. In their annual report, they reveal that ""many of the markets CompX serves are highly competitive, with a number of competitors offering similar products"". And as I expect the market demand to shrink, the competition may intensify as few players battle for their slice in a tighter market.
Inflation can raise the cost of raw materials and production, and subsequent price increases may not be well received by customers. CompX does have suppliers in China, and the weak Chinese economy may make it difficult for CompX to get the proper sourcing it needs to run its business smoothly.

Hold NL Industries

The two subsidiaries that NL owns are pretty average businesses, with low-growth prospects and high P/Es. That right away suggests to me that the upside is limited, and investors should be looking to rotate out of NL Industries. My prediction is that the stock trades sideways at around $8 per share, so new and existing investors should look for something else to buy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732401-united-states-cellular-q3-earnings-2-very-different-paths,4732401,United States Cellular Q3 Earnings: 2 Very Different Paths,"Summary

 -  US Cellular's Q3 earnings were disappointing with misses on both EPS and Revenue.
 -  If the sale to T-Mobile is approved, US Cellular shareholders are likely to see significant upside from the sale price, additional spectrum sales, and remaining assets.
 -  If the sale is not approved, shareholders are left with a struggling and underinvested telecom business.


I am updating my analysis on United States Cellular (NYSE:USM) in light of Q3 earnings, which were released pre-market on Friday, November 1st.
I previously rated US Cellular a buy as the valuation from the T-Mobile (TMUS) deal represented 40 to 50% upside potential between the payment for assets sold and the value of the remaining assets that could still be monetized.
Since then, US Cellular has risen 19%.


This is a very challenging moment for shareholders as the deal with T-Mobile is proceeding but has not yet been approved under antitrust concerns.
If the deal doesn't go forward, US Cellular is left with a struggling core business that can't keep up with the market. Using DCF analysis I value this business at a price target of $27.
If the deal does go through, shareholders are looking at significant upside between T-Mobile's consideration, further spectrum sale, and remaining assets. Using cash value, I value this scenario at a price target of $72.
With such a wide range, I lower my rating from buy to hold until we have more clarity on which way this will swing.

Earnings Recap

US Cellular's earnings were disappointing with EPS of $0.44 missing by $0.83 and revenue of $922 million missing by $19 million.


While revenue was down 4% across both service and equipment, costs were mitigated lifting profitability slightly. This in my opinion looks like management has checked out awaiting sale. Managing costs and taking the foot off the gas on revenue is classic pre-M&A.


Interestingly, management actually took AOIBDA and AEBITDA up given the cost trend in the business, again setting the business up for a sale to T-Mobile.


If the deal for T-Mobile goes through, then this is good news as T-Mobile will be one step ahead on an improved cost base. If the deal doesn't go through, US Cellular is left with an underinvested business and stagnant to declining revenue.

Valuation

For valuation I have built out two scenarios. In the first scenario, I assume the deal goes through. I use Raymond James' estimate on the value of US Cellular's assets. This unlocks a $1 billion price premium from the T-Mobile deal, an additional $1.0 billion in cash consideration for Spectrum (this is contingent upon the T-Mobile sale), and $3.7 billion in assets remaining to be monetized.
Assuming the sale goes through, cash value of the company is $6.2 billion after adjusting for debt, or $72 per share, 25% upside to today's prices.


For the scenario where the deal doesn't go through, I ran a DCF analysis with the following assumptions:
This analysis yields a price target of $27, 52% downside to today's prices.


Wall Street is valuing the company as if the deal goes through with a price target of $67, closer to my high scenario.



Core Business Is Struggling

US Cellular's core business is struggling. As shown above, service revenue was down 2%. This was largely driven by the postpaid wireless business which has lost subscribers 5 quarters in a row.
Previously there was some lift from Fixed Wireless, but growth in that business has slowed down. ARPU was also only up 2% year-over-year, below the rate of inflation.


This comes at a time when the market, and US Cellular's competitors are keeping up with the market or even growing beyond it. T-Mobile and AT&T (NYSE: T) are growing and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is stagnant, although Verizon's wireless business growing.
The overall market continues to grow at a rate above 3%.


This is all fine if the T-Mobile sale goes through. If the deal does not go through, US Cellular is left with a business in need of a rapid turnaround, else it will be downside for shareholders.

T-Mobile Sale Is Still Not Approved

From the earnings call, management says the deal is still proceeding as expected.
That said, the deal isn't done until all of the paperwork is signed. Both the FTC and the DOJ are challenging mergers at record levels, and a group of senators asked them to specifically review this transaction.


Looking at US Cellular and T-Mobile's overlap it would be hard not to expect at least some concessions on the deal if not a complete back. There are few areas that US Cellular does not overlap, and those areas are largely rural.


Until the deal is officially approved, this is a downside risk that shareholders need to consider.

Verdict

Regulatory approval of the US Cellular and T-Mobile deal presents a wide range of shareholder value, from $72 on the high end to $27 on the low end, with additional valuations possible in the event of concessions to close the deal.
US Cellular's core business is struggling as the company sets up for sale, and it is not competing well with the big 3. In addition, antitrust enforcement is at an all time high.
On the flip side, if the deal does go through, shareholders are looking at upside both from T-Mobile's premium and from additional spectrum sale that was recently announced.
Until there is more certainty around the sale, I lower my rating on USM from buy to hold.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732399-wolters-kluwer-full-year-outlook-buyback-progress,4732399,Wolters Kluwer: Spotlight On Full-Year Outlook And Buyback Progress,"Summary

 -  Wolters Kluwer has chosen to keep its existing full-year guidance unchanged, which is reasonable as the company's 9M 2024 financial metrics were in line with expectations.
 -  WOLTF is likely to complete its EUR 1 billion buyback plan for the current year, but the stock's low-to-mid single digit 2024 shareholder yield isn't sufficiently appealing in my view.
 -  My rating for Wolters Kluwer is still a Hold, as the company's latest disclosures pertaining to financial performance and capital return haven't changed my Neutral view of the stock.
 -  I am The Value Pendulum. I have over a decade of buy-side and sell-side experience in Asian equity markets. I lead the investing group Asia Value & Moat Stocks.


I continue to have a Hold investment rating for Wolters Kluwer N.V. (OTCPK:WOLTF) (OTCPK:WTKWY) [WKL:NA] stock. I am staying Neutral on WOLTF following an assessment of the company's recent disclosures. The company's 9M 2024 metrics, its full-year FY 2024 guidance, and its update on share buybacks haven't made me more bullish or more bearish on the stock. As such, I have made the decision to maintain a Hold rating for WOLTF.
My previous August 3, 2024 update reviewed Wolters Kluwer's financial results for the first half of this year.
Investors should know that they can trade in the company's shares on the OTC market and Euronext Amsterdam. According to data sourced from S&P Capital IQ, the three-month average daily trading values for Wolters Kluwer's Amsterdam-listed and OTC shares were around $65 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Readers can deal in Wolters Kluwer's shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam with US stockbrokers such as Interactive Brokers.

FY 2024 Guidance Is Intact As Per Recent Business Update

Wolters Kluwer reveals its full financial results on an semi-annual basis, but the company does offer relatively more limited business updates in the first and third quarters of the year. WOLTF's most recent financial update for the first nine months of the current year was largely consistent with investors' expectations in my view.
The company's top line adjusted for foreign exchange effects expanded by +6% in 9M 2024, and this was the same as its 1H 2024 constant-currency revenue increase. As such, it is fair to assume that Wolters Kluwer's top line performance for the latest quarter or Q3 2024 was roughly on par with its 1H 2024 revenue performance.
A key top line metric to watch is Wolters Kluwer's recurring revenue, which is a good indication of the company's earnings quality. WOLTF's recurring revenue as a proportion of its aggregate top line was 83% for 9M 2024, or slightly above the company's 1H 2024 recurring revenue contribution of 82%. The company's recurring revenues expanded by +7% YoY for both 1H 2024 and 9M 2024.
Normalized operating profit for WOLTF grew by +8% YoY on constant currency terms for the first half of 2024. Wolters Kluwer's normalized operating income also rose by +8% YoY in 9M 2024, if adjusted for foreign exchange effects.
For both 1H 2024 and 9M 2024, Wolters Kluwer's normalized operating income increased at a faster rate than its top line, which points to an improvement in operating profitability for these financial periods. In its recent quarterly business update, WOLTF revealed that its ""adjusted operating profit margin increased"" YoY in 9M 2024 without disclosing actual numbers.
As per the comparison of Wolters Kluwer's key financial metrics for 9M 2024 and 1H 2024 presented above, it will be reasonable to conclude that WOLTF's Q3 2024 results didn't throw up any major surprises to influence its full-year outlook. My point of view has been validated by the company's decision to leave its existing FY 2024 guidance unchanged.
The company is still anticipating ""good organic growth"", a modest +0.2 percentage points improvement in operating margin, and a slower normalized EPS increase at the ""mid- to high single-digit"" level for FY 2024 (versus FY 2023's +12% EPS growth) as per its 9M 2024 update.
Wolters Kluwer is now trading at pretty demanding consensus next twelve months' EV/EBIT and normalized P/E multiples of 24 times and 30 times, respectively according to S&P Capital IQ data. While a valuation premium for WOLTF is justified based on its high level of recurring revenues, the company's 9M 2024 update and unchanged full-year guidance don't support further valuation re-rating.

More Time Is Needed To See If New Partnership Delivers Results

The most significant recent corporate development for WOLTF, apart from its 9M 2024 results announcement, is the company's latest partnership to boost its Tax & Accounting segment's performance in the Asia Pacific geographical region.
In the first nine months of 2024, Wolters Kluwer's Tax & Accounting segment reported a good set of results with a +7% organic revenue increase. But the Tax & Accounting segment didn't do equally well in all its markets. WOLTF's Tax & Accounting segment achieved a organic top line expansion of +7% for both the North American and European sub-segments. Wolters Kluwer didn't disclose the actual financial numbers for the Tax & Accounting segment in other geographical regions. In its 9M 2024 business update, WOLTF indicated that ""Tax & Accounting Asia Pacific & ROW organic revenues were stable."" It is possible to infer that Wolters Kluwer's Tax & Accounting segment's Asia Pacific business is a relatively underperformer as compared to this segment's businesses in North America and Europe.
Wolters Kluwer announced in mid-September this year that its Tax & Accounting segment's Asia Pacific business entered into a ""strategic agreement with OneTeam Services Group"" to ""expand the capabilities"" in areas like ""tax compliance and data management."" I believe that this is a move made by WOLTF to improve the growth prospects of its Tax & Accounting segment's Asian operations. As a company with its roots in the Netherlands, it is natural that Wolters Kluwer has a comparatively stronger presence in Europe vis-a-vis other international markets, so it makes sense for WOLTF to rely on partnerships to strengthen its presence in Asia.
It is relevant to watch the future performance of Tax & Accounting segment's Asia Pacific business to assess if the new partnership with OneTeam Services Group is successful.

Year-to-Date Performance Is Comparable With Key Peer

Wolters Kluwer describes itself as a ""global leader in information, software solutions and services for professionals"" in the company's recent business update. A key peer for WOLTF, which has also revealed its 9M 2024 financial numbers, is RELX PLC (RELX) [REL:LN].
RELX's year-to-date results and forward looking guidance are similar to that for Wolters Kluwer. In its 9M 2024 trading update issued in late October, RELX disclosed that its top line increased by +7% YoY in the first nine months of the current year, or a high-single digit percentage growth rate similar to that of WOLTF. Looking ahead, RELX guided for ""continued strong underlying revenue growth with underlying adjusted operating profit growth slightly exceeding underlying revenue growth"" in 2024 as per its latest trading update without highlighting specific numbers. This is not much different from Wolters Kluwer's FY 2024 financial outlook.
Both RELX and WOLTF are beneficiaries of growing demand for data analytics offerings, as seen with their good year-to-date results and favorable guidance.
Notably, their valuations are also comparable. As highlighted above, Wolters Kluwer's consensus next twelve months' EV/EBIT and normalized P/E multiples were 24 times and 30 times, respectively. As a comparison, RELX is now trading at 23 times consensus forward EV/EBIT and 31 times consensus forward normalized P/E based on data taken from S&P Capital IQ.

Share Buyback Progress Is Within Expectations

WOLTF shared updates on the progress of the company's ongoing share repurchases as part of its 9M 2024 announcement.
For the first nine months of this year, Wolters Kluwer had spent EUR 762 million on share buybacks. This represents slightly more than three-quarters or 76.2% of its planned EUR 1 billion share repurchases for full-year FY 2024.
The stock boasts a potential FY 2024 buyback yield of 2.7% based on the assumption that the company completes the EUR 1 billion worth of buybacks within this year. This is a pretty reasonable assumption, considering the progress of Wolters Kluwer's existing buybacks.
Wolters Kluwer's consensus FY 2024 dividend yield is 1.4% as per S&P Capital IQ data. This means that the stock's potential shareholder yield for this fiscal year is 4.1% (2.7%+1.4%).
WOLTF's shareholder yield is decent, but not sufficiently compelling to drive a valuation re-rating via yield compression. In my opinion, Wolters Kluwer's shareholder yield will have to be at the high-single digit percentage level for the stock to be considered as undervalued.
On the other hand, Wolters Kluwer disclosed in its 9M 2024 update that it ""signed a third-party mandate to execute up to €100 million in share buybacks for the period starting January 2, 2025, up to and including February 24, 2025."" This translates into annualized share repurchases of approximately EUR 600 million for FY 2025.
It is important to note that WOLTF has allocated EUR 1 billion to share buybacks for both FY 2022 and FY 2023. The company is also likely to execute on EUR 1 billion worth of share repurchases in FY 2024 as mentioned above. As such, it is highly probable that Wolters Kluwer could possibly accelerate share buybacks after February 2025 and still do EUR 1 billion of buybacks next year based on its track record.
On the flip side, there aren't any signs suggesting that Wolters Kluwer will surpass the market's expectations (assumed to be EUR 1 billion as per recent history) for share repurchases in FY 2025.
In a nutshell, Wolters Kluwer's FY 2024 shareholder yield is a reasonable low-to-mid-single digit percentage; this isn't appealing enough to warrant a valuation re-rating. Also, WOLTF is likely to continue with EUR 1 billion of buybacks in the subsequent year at best, and there is nothing to indicate that there might be a positive surprise in terms of shareholder capital return.

Final Thoughts

I still have a Hold rating for Wolters Kluwer. The company's 9M 2024 performance is largely in line with how it has performed for 1H 2024. WOLTF is expected to spend EUR 1 billion on buybacks this year as per the company's earlier plans. It is fair to remain Neutral on Wolters Kluwer, as the company's outlook relating to shareholder capital return, profitability, and earnings growth for the full year has stayed the same.

Here's where we're going today:
Onward.

Winners And Losers of Higher Interest Rates

Higher interest rates are often thought of as universally negative, but actually, they are merely net negative for the US economy. That is, there are winners and losers of higher interest rates, but more losers than winners.
Consider the most heavily indebted organization in North America: the US federal government.
US Federal Debt To GDP:


As you can see, debt-to-GDP has jumped about 15 percentage points since the beginning of COVID-19.
The unprecedented level of fiscal stimulus done in 2020 and 2021 prevented a deep and prolonged recession and facilitated a V-shaped recovery in the economy, consumption, and labor market. But, given diminished production, it also virtually assured a surge of inflation as the economy recovered.
In a way, the federal government absorbed everyone's economic pain during the pandemic. It paid businesses to keep idle workers employed. It paid unemployed workers well above normal levels of unemployment benefits. It sent out stimulus checks to all but the highest-income households.
The government (both Trump and Biden, by the way) bent over backwards to soften the economic blow of the pandemic to the greatest extent possible.
The country is now paying the price for that government-sponsored cushioning. Interest expense on government debt has reached over $3 billion per day, and it will continue climbing for the foreseeable future.


If the US government held much cash on its balance sheet, net interest expense might be somewhat mitigated. But the government doesn't work that way. Cash doesn't tend to linger very long at the Treasury Department
Now contrast this with the net interest expense for the US corporate sector, which has practically been in free fall since the Fed started raising rates:


Wait, what? Interest rates go up, and corporations' net interest expense goes down?
Yes, that's for two reasons.
First, while federal debt to GDP has soared since the pandemic, corporate debt to GDP has plunged in the wake of the pandemic.
US Nonfinancial Corporate Debt To GDP:


After the initial, reflexive draw on credit lines at the outset of COVID, corporations have been steadily deleveraging.
In a way, the federal government's leveraging up has allowed corporations to deleverage.
Second, about a third of stock market capitalization is in the top 10 corporate giants, which are overwhelmingly cash rich.
High-tech mega-caps like Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) all boast significant cash holdings on their balance sheets:


With cash equivalents having yielded 5% or more (well above the average interest rates on what little debt they have) for the better part of a year now, their net interest income has soared.
There are clearly winners and losers from higher interest rates.
Winners:
Losers:
I think this dichotomy explains the last several years of stock market performance.
As the Fed Funds Rate rose in 2023 and the first half of 2024, Big Tech dramatically outperformed the most interest rate-sensitive parts of the stock market, especially real estate.
Then, finally, with a softer-than-expected inflation report for June, the real estate index (VNQ) began to majorly outperform Big Tech (exemplified below by the Nasdaq index (QQQ)):


That outperformance lasted almost three months and gave REIT investors (myself included) some hope for a sustained rally.
Then, as I discussed in last week's article ""7 Stocks I'm Buying As Recession Fears Fade & Trump Victory Odds Rise,"" the combination of buoyant economic reports, a potential Fed overshoot, and rising Trump victory odds triggered a reversal of fortunes. Since September 18-19th, Big Tech has returned to outperformance over real estate.


Here is an example of where the election results might actually make a difference to internal stock market performance, in my view.
If Trump wins, the Big Tech outperformance over REITs will likely continue.
If Harris wins (especially if there is divided government and therefore gridlock), REITs will likely return to outperformance over Big Tech.
Why?
Well, Trump is seen as likely to implement pro-growth policies such as deregulation and an extension of tax cuts, but he's also seen as likely to implement inflationary tariffs.
On the other hand, Harris is seen as likely to maintain the status quo or implement somewhat anti-growth policies while being unlikely to meaningfully alter the trajectory of inflation.

The 2024 Election In Context

Politics, like economics, are largely driven by fundamental, non-ideological forces that are out of anyone's control, like demographics.
I believe the US political divide is worsening based on several widening demographic gulfs:
The Republican Party has been trending increasingly toward a platform that primarily appeals to a coalition of rural, working class, and/or traditionalist people, while the Democratic Party has been trending increasingly toward a platform appealing to a coalition of urban, college-educated, and/or socially innovative people.
(""Socially innovative"" is my best attempt at an accurate yet universally acceptable term for the culturally liberal values most prominently found in American academia today.)
You can see this in an issue like immigration.
To the Right, too much immigration too fast threatens the traditional, patriotic, English-speaking vision of America they seek to preserve.
To the Left, cultural and racial diversity is a good in and of itself that enriches and strengthens the nation over time, even if there are some immediate growing pains to manage in the short-term.
Of interest to investors is the impact immigration has on labor markets, GDP growth, inflation, and therefore interest rates.
As I've mentioned multiple times in past articles, the US has entered into an indefinite, structural labor shortage due to the fact that the abnormally large Baby Boomer generation are retiring en masse. There is a huge mismatch among younger generations between the skills required for today's job openings and the experience/education younger workers actually have.
The result? Millions upon millions of available jobs in industries that native-born workers have no interest in or ability to fill.
While there are multiple applications (from native-born workers) for every barista job opening, millions of available jobs in agriculture, food preparation, food processing, construction, and other blue collar lines of work get basically no applications from native-born workers.
For example, some 70% of agriculture workers in the US are foreign-born. If you exclude row crop farms and look only at fruit, vegetable, and nut pickers, the share of the workforce that's foreign-born approaches 100%.
The same holds for a number of other gritty yet essential parts of the US economy. In certain parts of construction, food processing, and food preparation, the only native-born workers who even apply for jobs are felons who cannot obtain work anywhere else.
Look at the breakdown of native-born vs immigrant contributions to the US labor force since 2021 in the chart below on the top right corner:


If not for foreign-born workers, we would still see ""help wanted"" and ""now hiring"" signs everywhere we go. There would still be production delays and shortages of certain goods. It would still take months for certain tradespeople to make it out to job sites.
And, as a result, inflation would of course be higher.
None of this is to say our current immigration system is optimal for bringing in the types of foreign-born workers we need to fill job openings. Few immigration experts would say it is.
But the immigration question should be placed in the broader demographic context: Developing nations all across the world are aging and seeing their native-born workforces shrink, which will have untold negative consequences on their respective economies.


The US, along with the UK and Canada, is projected to see slow but positive growth in our working-age population over the next several years, compared to the rest of our G7 peers, who are seeing their working-age populations decline.
The reason for this positive growth in the working-age populations of all three of the English-speaking countries? Immigration.
The bottom line for investors is that it is a blessing to be capitalized on rather than a curse to be avoided that people from around the world want to immigrate to the US to attain a better life.
To the degree that the next US president and Congress are able to rework the immigration system to optimize it for our labor market needs, the economy should greatly benefit.
But to the degree that the immigration system fails to bring in enough of the kinds of workers who are willing and able to fill the job openings we have, the economy will suffer for it.
Tariffs/protectionism is one of those ideas that's popular among the Republican rural, blue collar, traditionalist coalition because they believe it will benefit them economically if more production is onshored/reshored to the US.
The persistent (and persistently inaccurate, according to a mountain of economic research, including from the US International Trade Commission) assertion is that foreigners pay for the tariffs.
I've argued in previous articles using charts and data that the 2018-2019 tariffs did cause price increases on the associated goods but did not increase US manufacturing employment and actually caused a downturn in overall US manufacturing output and profitability.
Here are a few such articles where I present the cold, hard data:
And as American consumers ended up paying for most of the 2018-2019 tariffs, the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics recently warned that American consumers would pay for the tariffs across a broad swathe of goods.


And this does not even consider the cost of the virtually inevitable retaliatory tariffs that would follow increased tariffs from the US government.
Articles in both the Washington Post and The Hill show that US businesses are already readying price hikes if the proposed wide-ranging tariffs are implemented. And in September, the world's largest retailer, Walmart (WMT), warned that it would be forced to raise prices in response to Trump's tariffs.
The rural/blue collar/traditionalist coalition may very well be correct that reversing the trend from production to services in the US economy would economically benefit them.
But given technological advancements, global supply chains, and the fact that American manufacturing labor is the most expensive in the world, it simply appears to be impossible to shift back toward manufacturing from services without causing significant inflation and economic damage.
On the other side of the political spectrum, the Democratic Party is also turning more protectionist in ways that appeal more to the urban/white collar/socially innovative coalition -- protecting the infant green energy hardware (solar panels, batteries, EVs, etc.) producers in the US.
While it remains to be seen what effect this will have, my hunch is that the Democratic form of protectionism will likewise raise prices on the associated goods while failing to ever engender industries that can stand on their own feet without government subsidies.
And now here's an example of a major issue that doesn't get fought about in US politics due to the fact that it doesn't neatly fit into either side of the demographic divides: the high and rising national debt load.
We discussed this a little bit above.
If the national debt obviously hurt one side's demographic coalition while helping the other's, we would see it become an object of division.
But the primary drivers of growth in government spending today and into the future are (1) the major entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare and (2) interest expense.
The beneficiaries of these programs are reliable voters. Neither party is willing to risk alienating them.
Therefore, whatever consequences come from excessive government debt, they are only likely to continue and increase in severity going forward.
As I've argued in the past, the most likely negative outcome from excessive and growing national debt is increasingly low economic growth.
What would change that? If a powerful alliance of countries (say, the BRICS) came together and decided to collectively ditch the US dollar and divest their US investments, especially US government debt.


Despite the BRICS' rise and G7's fall in share of global GDP over the last few decades, it does not appear imminent that they will declare economic war on the US dollar anytime soon. It simply wouldn't be in their interest, in my view.

The Buy List Today

Is it wise to maintain a REIT-heavy buy list in the face of another potential inflationary swell (driven this time by tariffs instead of issues unique to COVID)? Are REITs at risk of permanent or indefinite underperformance going forward if the US experiences a growth revival and inflationary spike?
I don't think so.
Let me give you six reasons why.
Therefore, regardless of the election outcome, I will continue to accumulate shares of reasonably valued, high-quality, well-capitalized, skillfully managed REITs.
When you're a contrarian that tries to buy stocks when they're undervalued, your buy list will naturally be populated largely by stocks with plenty of hair on them.
The two in this list that are undervalued and yet fundamentally near-flawless are EGP and HASI.
EGP's occupancy is down 100 basis points year-over-year, but at 96.7%, its occupancy is still above the nationwide industrial real estate average of about 94%. Same-property NOI growth continues to be strong, and importantly, EGP's capex and leasing costs are not eating meaningfully into its rising rent rates.
Meanwhile, even though HASI is up ~95% YoY right now, its P/E ratio of 14x is still well below its historically average level of ~19x. The shift toward green energy and sustainability in the economy look enduring, regardless of the election results. Plus, HASI's range of investable opportunities is much wider than for renewable power producers. For example, it recently made a $207 million investment into loans for renewable natural gas.
The market didn't seem to care for AMH's occupancy slip to 95.1% compared to 95.8% in Q2 2024, nor the decline in rent growth. Mark-to-market is only in the low single-digits for rent, which the market also seemed to find unimpressive.
I am undeterred. AMH is a well-capitalized, relatively low debt single-family rental REIT with a 60,000+ portfolio of SFRs, concentrated largely in fast-growing Sunbelt markets. Core FFO per share increased 6.3% YoY, while AFFO per share rose 8.0% YoY.
The future still looks bright for this owner/developer of SFRs.
It's tough to say when the bottom will be in for life science property values or ARE's rent rates.
While over 3/4ths of ARE's portfolio is in high-quality, highly desirable mega-campuses in top R&D cities, the huge surge of supply hitting the market this year is understandably taking some toll on ARE's results.


I believe the negative impact of supply will prove short-term, though.
Life science isn't traditional office. Life science does not have a problem with long-term tenant demand like traditional office space does. It has a temporary oversupply situation.
I maintain that ARE will suffer less than the average life science building from this oversupply situation, and when the market turns, ARE's upside will be greater than the average life science building.
Why is this Delaware-based, lightly leveraged, conservatively managed water utility company seeing its share price slide continuously? Tough to say.
The valuation is compelling.


And the dividend remains well-covered at about a 60-65% payout ratio.
If you're okay with a very boring 4%-per-year dividend growth rate, I think ARTNA makes a very nice addition to a conservative dividend growth portfolio.
I clearly spoke too soon last week when I mentioned that it appears energy stocks are preemptively pricing in a Trump victory. Renewable energy stocks (RNRG) have declined recently, but energy stocks (XLE) haven't really reacted much to Trump's rising odds of victory.
In fact, as the risk of escalation in the Middle East simmers down, both renewables and fossil fuels stocks are now getting hammered:


Permian Resources, a low-debt and handsomely cash flowing upstream energy company, has sold off in tandem with the rest of the energy sector.
I am no oil market guru and can't predict the future path of oil or gas prices, but I am comforted immensely by PR's lack of near-term debt maturities, strong capital allocation, and low production costs.


A downside is that PR remains sub-investment grade rated, although management is making a concerted effort to achieve investment grade status.
TD recently got slapped on the wrist pretty hard by US regulators over its purported failure to adequately prevent money laundering activities by drug cartels. The US hit TD with a $3 billion fine as well as an asset cap on its US banking arm for the foreseeable future.
TD will have to demonstrate that its risk management and anti-money laundering practices have improved before the cap is lifted, and that could take years.
This is definitely disappointing, since part of the reason I like TD is because the company has been trying to grow its presence in the United States while maintaining a leading market share in Canada as well.
My impression so far is that the full extent of the damage to TD is now done and known.
The dividend, which has been paid without a single cut in 167 years, does not appear to be in danger from this setback, but dividend growth will likely be minimal for as long as TD's US banking growth is limited and its compliance costs elevated.
To my mind, the 5.4% dividend yield makes the wait worthwhile. But I'll be keeping an eye on TD to make sure there aren't any damaging ripple effects to come from this regulatory wrist-slap.

 -  Invesco S&P International Developed Momentum ETF holds 183 international stocks with high momentum.
 -  The IDMO ETF is overweight in financials, quite heavy in Japan, and has fundamental growth characteristics.
 -  IDMO has outperformed other momentum ETFs in the same stock universe over the last seven years.
 -  IDMO is a best-of-breed ex-US developed markets momentum ETF, but concentration in financials and volatility make it a risky investment.
 -  I am Fred Piard, a quantitative analyst with a PhD in computer science. I run the investing group Quantitative Risk & Value where I share data driven portfolios and risk indicators.


IDMO strategy

Invesco S&P International Developed Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:IDMO) was launched on 02/24/2012 and tracks the S&P World Ex-U.S. Momentum Index. It has a portfolio of 183 stocks, a 30-day SEC yield of 2.24% and a total expense ratio of 0.25%. Distributions are paid quarterly. As described in the prospectus by Invesco, the selection process starts from the S&P Developed ex-U.S. & Korea LargeMidCap Index. A momentum score is calculated based on the 12-month price return, excluding the most recent month, adjusted for volatility. Stocks ranked in the top 20% are included in the underlying index and weighted with a modified market capitalization methodology. The portfolio turnover rate in the most recent fiscal year was 131%. This article will use as a benchmark a developed markets index excluding the U.S., represented by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA).

IDMO portfolio

IDMO has about 95% of asset value in large and mega-cap companies. Japan is the heaviest country by far, with 25.5% of assets. Other countries are below 11%. Unlike EFA, IDMO has some exposure in Canada. Compared to the benchmark, it significantly underweights the UK, France and Switzerland. The next chart lists the top 10 countries, representing 90% of assets.


The portfolio is overweight in financials, with 39.6% of asset value in this sector. Industrials weigh 21%, and other sectors are below 10%. Compared to the benchmark, IDMO significantly overweights financials, underweights mostly consumer goods and services, and almost ignores utilities.


The top 10 holdings, listed in the next table, represent 27.6% of asset value and the top name weighs 6.1%. The portfolio is more concentrated than EFA, where the top 10 weigh 14.1% and the largest position is only 2.1%.

Fundamentals

IDMO is more expensive than EFA regarding valuation metrics, although the P/E ratio is close to the benchmark, as reported in the next table. It has higher growth rates, especially cash flow growth. Morningstar and Fidelity classify IDMO in the “Foreign Large Growth” ETF category, in accordance with these metrics.
Data source: Fidelity.

Performance

Since its inception in February 2012, IDMO is 4.9% ahead of EFA in total return, but it was lagging it until 2023. The gap in annualized return is hardly significant.


IDMO has outperformed the benchmark by about 6.5% in 2024, showing higher volatility and a deeper drawdown.



IDMO vs. competitors

The next table compares characteristics of IDMO and four international momentum ETFs with a focus on developed markets:
IDMO has the lowest fee of these funds. The next chart compares total returns, starting on 10/25/2017 to match all inception dates. IDMO beats its peers by a significant margin.


However, it comes in third position in 2024:



Takeaway

Invesco S&P International Developed Momentum ETF holds 183 international stocks with high momentum. IDMO portfolio is overweight in financials, quite heavy in Japan and has fundamental growth characteristics. Its return since inception is marginally ahead of a developed markets benchmark. However, it has outperformed other momentum ETFs in the same stock universe over the last seven years and has a lower fee. In summary, IDMO is a best-of-breed ex-US developed markets momentum ETF, but concentration in financials and volatility make it a risky long-term investment. It may be better used in swing-trading and tactical allocation strategies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732262-weekly-indicators-bearish-steepening-of-interest-rates-but-strong-coincident-data,4732262,"Weekly Indicators: Bearish Steepening Of Interest Rates, But Strong Coincident Data","Summary

 -  Long leading indicators turned slightly negative, as a bearish steepening of the yield curve was reflected in higher mortgage rates.
 -  Short leading indicators remain slightly positive, as weak manufacturing is offset by low gas prices, and initial jobless claims look like they are on the cusp of turning more positive.
 -  Coincident indicators, led by consumption, are strongly positive.
 -  While there are some signs of weakness, the expansion continues to remain intact.


Purpose

I look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy, they provide a good nowcast of the economy, and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available. They are also an excellent way to “mark your beliefs to market.” In general, I go in order of long leading indicators, then short leading indicators, then coincident indicators.

A Note on Methodology

Data is presented in a “just the facts, ma'am” format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized.
Where relevant, I include 12-month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right. All data taken from St. Louis FRED unless otherwise linked.
A few items (e.g., Financial Conditions indexes, regional Fed indexes, stock prices, the yield curve) have their metrics based on long-term studies of their behavior.
Where data is seasonally adjusted, generally it is scored positively if it is within the top 1/3 of that range, negative in the bottom 1/3, and neutral in between. Where it is not seasonally adjusted, and there are seasonal issues, waiting for the YoY change to change sign will lag the turning point. Thus, I make use of a convention: data is scored neutral if it is less than 1/2 as positive/negative as at its 12-month extreme.
With long leading indicators, which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole, there is an additional rule: data is automatically negative if, during an expansion, it has not made a new peak in the past year, with the sole exception that it is scored neutral if it is moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high.
For all series where a graph is available, I have provided a link to where the relevant graph can be found.

Recap of monthly reports

November data started out with a poor employment report, which was significantly affected by both the Boeing strike (probably subtracting 44,000 from the total) and the unquantified effects of Hurricane Milton. The ISM manufacturing report showed yet another month of contraction.
September data included a small increase in construction spending, including residential construction spending, increases in personal income and spending, but a slight decline in the savings rate, small increases in repeat sales prices as measured by both the FHFA and Case Shiller Indexes, and a decline in all components of the JOLTS employment index aside from hiring.
In the rearview mirror, Q# GDP came in strongly positive, as did the Employment Cost Index.

Long leading indicators

Interest rates and credit spreads
Rates
(Graph at Moody's Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield | FRED | St. Louis Fed.)
Yield curve
(Graph at 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity | FRED | St. Louis Fed.)
30-Year conventional mortgage rate (from Mortgage News Daily) (graph at link)
Long-term bonds’ have been neutral since the end of February. Both corporate and Treasury’s turned positive two months ago, making new 1 year lows. But with recent increases, both reverted to the neutral portion of their range. The 10-year minus 3 month spread now looks on the verge of un-inverting. By contrast, the increase in mortgage rates has been enough to turn them back to negative.
Housing
Mortgage applications (from the Mortgage Bankers Association)
*[SA] = seasonally adjusted, [NSA] = not seasonally adjusted.
(Graph at Our Charts.)
Real Estate Loans (from the FRB)
(Graph at Real Estate Loans, All Commercial Banks | FRED | St. Louis Fed.)
Mortgage rates, like bond yields, made multi-decade new highs late last year. Five weeks ago, they made a new 12-month low, turning positive. But as indicated above, they have creased enough to turn back negative.
Purchase mortgage applications last made a new long term last year at this time. They have meandered since, warranting a neutral rating. Four weeks ago, they finally turned higher YoY, but have since declined back to their 52-week lows, warranting a change all the way back to negative. Refinancing has traced a similar trajectory, recently turning significantly higher YoY by enough to warrant a positive rating, and remains so.
Late last year, real estate loans sank below 1/2 of their 12-month-high, the last housing indicator to turn negative, and have generally continued to worsen. They paused for several months, but in the last several months made several new YoY lows.
Money supply
The Federal Reserve has discontinued this weekly series. Data is now only released monthly. September data was just released last week:
No recession has happened without a YoY real M1 negative, or YoY real M2 below +2.5%. Real M2 fell below that threshold in March 2022. Real M1 also turned negative as of May 2022.
Real M2 finally turned higher YoY this month. Real M1 is still negative, Both are the “least bad” they have been since early 2022. On an absolute level, the post-pandemic bottom for real M1 was in February; for real M2 it was last October). In the past, when either has turned positive YoY, that was near either the middle or end of recessions, which would warrant a change to positive. And so it is with real M2 this week.
Corporate profits (Q3 70% actual + 30% estimated) from I/B/E/S via FactSet at p. 32)
FactSet estimates earnings, which are replaced by actual earnings as they are reported, and are updated weekly. The “neutral” band is +/-3%. I also average the previous two quarters together, until at least 100 companies have actually reported. This metric was negative in Q4 2023, turned neutral in Q1, and very positive in Q2. Q3 earnings q/q were negative through last week, but this week’s reports powered a sharp increase. Nevertheless, because the increase is less than 3%, this rating is still neutral.
Credit conditions (from the Chicago Fed) (graph at link)
In these indexes, lower = better for the economy. The Chicago Fed's Adjusted Index's real break-even point is roughly -0.25. In the leverage index, a negative number is good, a positive poor. The historical breakeven point has been -0.5 for the unadjusted Index. If this Index goes below -0.60, its rating will change to positive.
Except for the leverage index for a period last year, all of these have been relentlessly either neutral or positive all throughout the post-pandemic period. The unadjusted index is neutral now, and the adjusted index and the leverage subindex are positive for the economy.

Short leading indicators

Economic Indicators from the late Jeff Miller’s “Weighing the Week Ahead”
The Miller Score is designed to look 52 weeks ahead for whether a recession is possible. Any score over 500 means no recession. This number fell below that threshold at the beginning of August 2021, so not only is it negative, but we are now well into the “recession eligible” period. This indicator is heavily influenced by both the yield curve and the still very low unemployment rate (expecting a reversal), which explains why it remains so negative. With the recent Fed rate decline, together with the decline in gas prices, it jumped higher.
The St. Louis Financial Stress index is one where a negative score is a positive for the economy, and during its limited existence, has risen above zero before a recession by less than one year. It remains very positive.
The BCIp, deteriorated sharply earlier last year below its recession-signalling threshold, but then improved sufficiently so that IM rescinded the recession signal. The signal then activated again for several months, but as of six months ago, IM once again stated that their system no longer forecast a recession.
Trade weighted US$
Early in 2023 both measures of the US$ turned positive. Five months ago, for the first time since then, the US$ as to major currencies turned slightly higher YoY, changing its rating to neutral, and was then joined by the broad measure. Both briefly reverted to positive, but both then turned neutral. One month ago, the measure as to major currencies turned positive, followed by the full index two weeks ago. The first measure reverted to neutral last week.
Commodity prices
Bloomberg Commodity Index
(Graph at https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/bcom?countrycode=xx.)
Bloomberg Industrial metals ETF (from Bloomberg) (graph at link)
Both of these measures had improved in the last several months, and industrial commodities surged to new 12 month highs one month ago before backing off. Both of these, for a few weeks, were close to the top of their 12-month ranges, so were positive, but the broad measure has since turned back negative.
Stock prices S&P 500 (from CNBC) (graph at link)
We have had multiple new all-time highs, including one week ago, but no new 3 month lows, so this indicator remains positive.
Regional Fed New Orders Indexes
(*indicates report this week)
The regional average is more volatile than the ISM manufacturing index, but usually correctly forecasts its month-over-month direction. Since spring 2022, these gradually declined to neutral and then negative. Recently, they became “less negative,” but reversed in the last several months. The indexes have varied sharply this year, but at all times have remained negative.
Employment metrics
Initial jobless claims
(Graph at St. Louis FRED)
Against very strong comparisons last year, both measures of new jobless claims turned slightly higher YoY two weeks ago and so changed from positive to neutral. It would take an increase of 10% or higher YoY for them to turn negative. Three weeks ago, I wrote that “If the four-week average does rise above 10%, I will go ahead and make the change then, but likely with a major asterisk” because of the major impact from the hurricanes. I did so last week, and will maintain that until the 4-week average declines back under 10% high YoY. It is important to note that the biweekly average is only up 3.5%, so that could easily happen next week.
Temporary staffing index (from the American Staffing Association) (graph at link)
During 2022, the comparisons at first slowly and then more sharply deteriorated, and by early last year had turned negative. After improving somewhat, since last autumn YoY comparisons faded again. It remains frankly recessionary. I suspect this is a secular change and giving a false signal as a result.
Tax Withholding (from the Department of the Treasury)
These have been very positive for almost all of this year. This week’s poor comparison was almost certainly influence by the first of the month being included for last year but not this year. For the entire month of October last year, the total was $263.5 B. With one day left this year, the total so far is $257.8 B. In other words, it will only take less than $6 B on the report for the 31st for this October to exceed last October.
Oil prices and usage (from the E.I.A.)
(Graphs at This Week In Petroleum Gasoline Section — U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).)
Oil prices first declined into the bottom 1/3rd of their 3-year range, and so turned positive several months ago. They have fluctuated since then, recently declining enough to change back from neutral to positive, and remained so this week.
Gas prices are close to the lows of their 3-year range, and so are also positive. Except for several weeks in March, until two months ago, mileage driven had been negative YoY since February. It also turned neutral and is now positive.
Note: given this measure’s extreme volatility, I believe the best measure is against their 3-year average.
Bank lending rates
The TED Spread has been discontinued, and as of last week, so was LIBOR. At the suggestion of a reader, I began to track the SOFR instead. Unfortunately, SOFR has only been existing since 2018, so there is no track record as to how it might behave around normal recessions (vs. the pandemic). Over the past 5 years, it does appear to have matched the trend in LIBOR. Given the alternatives, I am now including it in my list of indicators in the conclusion.

Coincident indicators


St. Louis FRED Weekly Economic Index

This measure remained in a neutral range during most of 2023 before breaking above 2.0 last December, changing its rating to positive, and again for several weeks off and on this year, oscillating between neutral and positive. Except for several weeks, it has been positive again since four months ago.
Restaurant reservations YoY (from Open Table) State of the Restaurant Industry | OpenTable
This index went on hiatus for six weeks this spring, and I discontinued coverage. When it resumed, it appeared that previous data, which had averaged -3% to -7% YoY earlier this year, had been substantially revised, and retroactively averaged +4% for most of this calendar year. With that massive caution, I reinstated coverage. Over the past few months it has swung between positive, neutral, and negative several times. It was negative several weeks ago, but then switched back to positive.
Consumer spending
The Redbook index briefly turned negative last summer, before rebounding. Comparisons faded somewhat during December, before rebounding again after Christmas, then fading in February, and rebounding since. It remains near the higher end of its comparisons in the past year. The link above goes to a 5-year graph to best show the comparison.
Consumer inflation by Truflation (Independent, economic & financial data in real time on-chain | Truflation)
This recent addition is a daily update to inflation, similar to the “billion prices project” of the last decade (which required a subscription). I have not added this to my list below of coincident or leading indicators, but needless to say, it is an up-to-the-moment reading on this essential indicator.
Real Consumer Spending
This metric premiered at the beginning of this year. One of my most important mantras is that consumption leads employment. Real retail sales have a long history of doing so, but are only reported on a monthly basis.
The weekly result is derived simply by subtracting YoY inflation as measured by Truflation from the YoY change in nominal consumer spending as measured by Redbook. While it will be moderately noisy, it should anticipate changes in the monthly measures ahead of time. It backed off from the 12-month high it set in February, and then gradually rebounded, and made another 12 month high several months ago.
Transport
Railroads (from the AAR)
(Graph at Railfax Report — North American Rail Freight Traffic Carloading Report.)
Shipping transport
Rail data has been very volatile since early 2023, with lots of volatility from positive to negative and back again. For many weeks, it was neutral, but one month ago, it turned positive. One month ago, it retreated to mixed, then went negative for one week, but then rebounded, and now is positive again.
Harpex was as high as nearly 4500 almost 2 years ago, but declined as low as 810 in December of last year before rising almost relentlessly since, setting repeated 12-month highs in the past two months. The usual interpretation for this is that demand is straining against supply, showing a strong global economy, and thus very positive.
Similarly, the BDI was in a generally declining trend throughout 2022 before bottoming at a three-year low of 530 in February 2023. The overall trend has been higher since then, rising to a high of 3346 in December, probably reflecting the Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. This year its low was 1309 in January, and its recent high was 2419 in March. It has now declined into the bottom 1/3rd of its one-year range, so has turned negative.
I am wary of reading too much into price indexes like this, since they are heavily influenced by supply (as in, a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade) as well as demand.
Steel production (American Iron and Steel Institute)
This metric was negative for most of 2022, then gradually improved in 2023. In the past few months it has bounced all over between positive, negative, and neutral. It has been oscillating between positive and negative for most of this year. It was negative for the last month before recovering enough to score neutral this week.

Summary And Conclusion

Below are this week’s spreadsheets of the long leading, short leading, and coincident readings. Check marks indicate the present reading. If there has been a change this week, the prior reading is marked with an X:
Further increases in interest rates, especially for mortgages, tipped the long leading indicators back into slightly negative territory this week. Corporate profits are on the cusp of turning positive, but not yet.
The short leading indicators weakened a little, but are still slightly positive. The coincident indicators remain very positive.
Perhaps what is most interesting in the near future is the un-inverting of the yield curve, but in the direction of higher rates. If the Fed cuts rates again, will that be because inflation has become tame or because economic data has weakened?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732384-cincinnati-financial-improved-results-are-reflected-in-valuation-downgrade,4732384,Cincinnati Financial: Improved Results Are Reflected In Valuation (Rating Downgrade),"Summary

 -  CINF delivered solid Q3 results, even as catastrophe losses increased.
 -  Underwriting results are now in keeping with long-term expectations, though faster personal lines growth is a headwind.
 -  Its investment portfolio has benefitted from higher rates and the rise in the equity market, boosting fair value.
 -  After its rally, shares are now in-line with fair value, leading me to reduce my rating to a hold.


Shares of Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) have been a solid performer over the past year, gaining over 38%. The insurer has benefited from improving underwriting results, given favorable premium inflation. Additionally, its relatively unique investment portfolio, which has a large portion invested in public stocks, has boosted fair value thanks to the strong market rally. I last covered CINF in July, rating shares a “buy,” and since then, the stock has gained 23%, well ahead of the market’s 7% rise. With shares rallying past my $135 price target in response to Q3 results, now is a good time to revisit CINF. I am moving shares to a hold.


In the company’s third quarter, Cincinnati earned $1.42 in adjusted EPS, which missed consensus by $0.06. Reported net income was $5.20 due to $956 million in investment gains, thanks to mark-to-market benefits from the equity market rally. Because its stock portfolio is inherently volatile, I recommend looking to non-GAAP results as a better indicator of the insurance operation’s underlying performance.
Cincinnati has benefited from a return to better underwriting results after some missteps in 2022/2023. In the third quarter, the company had a 97.4% property casualty combined ratio, up 3% from last year. As a reminder, a combined ratio of 100% means that an insurer is breaking even on its policies; CINF made ~2.6% on its policies. However, it is also important to remember that Q3 can seasonally be the higher combined ratio quarter because of the US hurricane season.
This leads to more catastrophe losses in Q3 than the other quarters. Indeed, the company had 13.8% current year cat losses, up from 9.4% last year. This rise in cat losses explains the higher combined ratio. Each year, the impact of the storm season is somewhat random, so ex-cat results can help to provide a clearer picture of underlying momentum. Its current year combined ratio fell by 90bps before cats to 86.8%, encouraging validation of ongoing improvement.
I would also note this quarter’s results were more in-line with a typical Q3 as the hurricane season in 2023 was especially light. Its 13.8% in loss compares to a 5-year average of 12.2%. The ~9.4% last year was really an outlier. So far in 2023, CINF has had a 96.5% combined ratio, well within its 92-98% target. With a normal hurricane season, a mid-range combined ratio outcome speaks to solid underwriting trends.
Thanks to this, underwriting income is up 53% year to date at $228 million. I was also glad to see the company had $71 million of favorable prior year developments. Essentially, past policies were more profitable than initially modelled. CINF conservatively takes reserves and generally see favorable revisions.
Drilling further into results, the company’s earned premiums rose by 13% to $2.3 billion. CINF is primarily a commercial insurer, but it has been trying to extend into high-net-worth personal insurance where margins can be wider, after the business is scaled. Commercial lines rose 8% while personal rose 30%, and excess and surplus rose by 15%. CINF continues to succeed in bringing new clients onto its platform. It generated $406 million in new business premiums, up 30%.
Its primary commercial unit continues to perform well. Commercial premiums were $1.1 billion with a 93% combined ratio, down 220bps from last year. Rate increases were high single digits as the company continues to pass on and recapture inflation. These rate increases help to reduce the risk of its policies and are a major reason for the improved underlying underwriting results.
Results in its personal lines are more mixed, in my view. Personal lines premiums were $678 million, but there was a 110% loss ratio from 100% last year. Now, I would note that its current year before catastrophes ratio of 82.8% was 360bps better than last year. However, there was a 12.7 point increase in cat losses. While CINF is a large business insurer, it is still building out its personal business, particularly at the high-end of the market.
Given lower brand recognition, CINF may be having to offer more aggressive pricing to win customers and drive this premium growth. After the business scales, it should be able to recapture pricing. Ultimately, diversifying the business is a positive, but I expect this growth to continue to be a near-term drag on results. Encouragingly, it did see double-digit rate increases, a bit faster than in commercial lines. This will help to reduce the drag on results, though personal is likely to continue to underperform commercial through at least 2025 in my view.
CINF’s premium increases have been higher than the industry norm. As you can see below, premium inflation is rising about 4% now. As such, I do expect premium inflation to slow over the next year. Importantly, premium inflation is higher than overall inflation, so this is still supportive of ongoing combined ratio improvement. 4% premium growth in a 2% inflation world is preferable to 6% premium growth in a 7% inflation world.


Aside from underwriting, CINF generated $258 million in investment income, up 15%. It earned $187 million in interest, up about 20%. Dividends were flat at $68 million. CINF has benefitted from reinvesting maturities in this more elevated rate environment. Within its $29.1 billion portfolio of investments and cash, it has $15.6 billion in fixed maturities. They have a 4.8% yield, up 36bps from last year.
CINF is somewhat unique in that it also has a large equities portfolio, of about $11.5 billion. Interestingly, the company sold $959 million of net equities in the quarter, though management said there was not a change in strategy. CINF has $9.9 billion of reserves, up 10% from last year as well as $4.8 billion of unearned premiums. Its high-quality bond portfolio essentially is used to cover insurance exposure while its equity portfolio provides growth opportunity. Given its bond portfolio, CINF is highly unlikely to be a forced seller of stocks to cover losses.
Because of this investment portfolio, I believe it best to value CINF on a sum of the parts basis, valuing its insurance unit and then adding on the value of its stock portfolio. Back In July, I forecast $6.40-$6.55 in 2024 EPS, and based on a sum of the parts valuation, I was targeting $135. This assumed a 96% combined ratio. Through nine months, it is running at 96.5%, though Q4 is seasonally lower.
As such, I expect about a 96.25% combined ratio or about $775 million in insurance earnings. However, the gain in the stock market had increased the value of its equity portfolio by about $6/share, likely closer to $7 given gains since September 30th. As such, I now see fair value closer to $138-140.
In other words, the market is reflecting the better underwriting results and gains in its investment portfolio. After a 40% rally over the past year, I do not see much more upside, though shares are not sufficiently overvalued to require selling. Shares are likely to trade in-line with the market, given its large, diverse equity portfolio. With shares around fair value, a secure 2.3% dividend yield, and returns that are likely to be correlated to the market, I am moving CINF down to a hold. Outperformance has largely been achieve, and CINF is likely a market performer from here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732397-sofi-firing-on-all-cylinders,4732397,SoFi: Firing On All Cylinders,"Summary

 -  SoFi Technologies exceeded profit expectations in 3Q24, gaining 756,000 new members and raising its EBITDA forecast for the third time.
 -  The Financial Services segment grew its contribution profit by nearly 3,000% YoY and saw a 66% increase in net interest income.
 -  Although SoFi’s forward profit multiple is high at 38.4x, the fintech’s strong growth profile, with anticipated profit growth of 145% YoY next year, justifies this valuation.


Despite fintech SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) beating estimates and raising its forecast for the third time in a row, the fintech’s stock tanked more than 6% directly after the presentation of third quarter earnings.
In my view, SoFi Technologies presented very robust 3Q24 results that point to steady growth in the competitive online banking market that the fintech is active in.
I also think that the strong growth number with have seen in terms of members in 3Q24 fundamentally establishes SoFi Technologies as a growth investment in the online banking market.
Financial Services is seeing extremely impressive growth and the stock, from a risk/reward angle, is quite compelling, though not cheap.

My Rating History

My last stock classification on SoFi Technologies wasBuy primarily because the fintech profited from robust member growth and because the online bank raised its forecast a second time in July.
SoFi Technologies now raised its forecast for 2024 adjusted sales and EBITDA for a third time, suggesting that the fintech may have much more momentum that it gets credit for.

SoFi Technologies Surprises Investors With Another Raise In The 2024 Forecast

But first things first. SoFi Technologies surpassed profit estimates for the third quarter, with the fintech earning $0.05 per share compared to the projected $0.04 Wall Street average.
In terms of sales, SoFi Technologies also beat the average forecast of $632.3 by a substantial margin (actual sales were $697.1 million).
SoFi Technologies released impressive growth numbers for the third quarter 2024, particularly as they relate to the fintech’s actual member growth. In the third quarter, Sofi Technologies grew to a total customer base of 9.37 million, after 756K new members joined the platform.
Though the growth rate in percentage terms has declined rather steadily in the last couple of quarters, in absolute numbers the fintech is doing quite well: From January until September this year, 2.0 million new customers joined SoFi Technologies. Growth in members attests to the strength of SoFi Technologies’ brand value and highlights long-term growth potential in the market for online banks.
SoFi Technologies offers Lending and Financial Services products to its customers. Lending is the biggest segment for SoFi Technologies as one would expect from an online bank.
Lending produced $238.9 million in contribution profits, more than twice as much as Financial Services, and the segment enjoyed decent growth of 17%. That said, though, the actual growth for SoFi Technologies takes place in the Financial Services segment.
SoFi Technologies earned $99.8 million in contribution profit in its Financial Services segment in the third quarter, up almost 3,000% YoY. The segment is a direct beneficiary of SoFi Technologies expanding its platform reach and its ability to draw in more deposits.
The segment’s net interest income, for instance, was up 66% YoY to $154.1 million, primarily due to growth in the platform’s deposits.

Guidance And Profit Multiple

For the full year, the fintech anticipates $2.535 to $2.550 billion in net sales, up from $2.425 to $2.465 billion in the prior quarter. The new 2024 forecast reflects 22-23% YoY growth as opposed to 17-19% YoY previously.
SoFi Technologies also revised its adjusted EBITDA forecast from $605-615 million to $640-645 million, a hike of more than $30 million. As a matter of fact, this was the third time that the fintech raised its forecast for the present financial year amid momentum in members and in Financial Services.
The market presently models a substantial jump in profits for SoFi Technologies next year which points to the expectation of robust expansion potential in both Lending and Financial Services, but particularly the latter.
The fact that the fintech also just raised its forecast for 2024 for the third time could translate to some positive profit estimate corrections in the near-future.
As it stands right now, the market models $0.27 per share in profits for SoFi Technologies next year, reflecting back to us YoY profit growth of 145%.
SoFi Technologies’ leading profit multiple (for next year) is thus 38.7x which might seem like a high multiple for some investors. With that said, SoFi Technologies’ has a very compelling growth profile and is seeing momentum in both its members and its main business Financial Services which should be driving interest in the stock moving forward.
Compare this, for instance, to PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) which is selling at a much lower profit multiple of 16.5x but according to the most up-to-date estimates for next year, the fintech is anticipated to produce only 8% YoY growth. Therefore, SoFi Technologies could achieve up to three times faster growth in EPS which is something that I am surely willing to pay a premium for.

Why The Investment Thesis Might Be Off

SoFi Technologiesis growing at a quick pace and investors have been either overly bullish or bearish in the past, depending on what kind of bullish or bearish news about the fintech prevailed at either time. The stock has proven to be very volatile as well and has often made outsized movements to either the upside or downside before and after earnings.
In the long-run, I anticipate that SoFi Technologies will grow its platform and grow its reach. With the Financial Services segment firing on all cylinders, I think that a slowdown here would be particularly problematic for the investment thesis.

My Conclusion

SoFi Technologies’ stock tumbled more than 6% after 3Q24 earnings on Tuesday, but this decrease might be a healthy pullback: In the month of October until just before earnings, SoFi Technologies’ stock rose 46%.
Taking into a consideration that SoFi Technologies’ had more than 750K new customers join its platform in the last quarter, Financial Services’ profits are surging and that the fintech raised its forecast for a third time, I think the investment thesis here is wholly intact.
SoFi Technologies may seem expensive with a forward profit multiple of 38.4x, but I’d rather invest in a growing fintech than in a cheaper option, like PayPal, that lacks growth. Buy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732381-ethe-ethereum-quietly-positive-october-ethusd-cyrpto,4732381,ETHE: Ethereum's Quietly Positive October (Rating Downgrade),"Summary

 -  Ethereum's price appreciation in October was non-existent even as Bitcoin rallied over 10%.
 -  The network itself is showing promising signs with growth in fees, daily active addresses, and stablecoin transfer volume.
 -  Based on spot ETF holdings data, it appears as though the net outflow from US spot products is slowing down.


In my last coverage of Ethereum (ETH-USD) for Seeking Alpha at the beginning of October, I shared a somewhat cautious outlook on the native asset of the network due to what I viewed as a weakening bull case for the coin itself. I left readers with this takeaway:
Since then, ETH hasn't really gone much of anywhere. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) put up a 10% October while ETH was essentially flat:


This under-performance relative to Bitcoin in October continued a multi-year decline in the ETH/BTC ratio that has worsened seemingly in a straight line since September 2022:


Despite the woeful performance of ETH the asset, there have been some positive signs in the Ethereum ecosystem. In this update, we'll look at Ethereum network data in the month of October, trends in the broader ETH ecosystem, capital flows, and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:ETHE).

Network Data

The two primary ways that I like to examine public Blockchain networks are through daily active addresses and network fees. For the remainder of this article, I'll be shortening 'daily active addresses' to 'DAAs.' As I've pointed out before and will point out again, DAAs are not the same thing as DAUs or unique users for traditional platforms. But for the purpose of judging permission-less public chain data, it's the best we have.
Given that, the long term trend in DAAs on Ethereum's main layer is flat to down. However, since the Ethereum ecosystem has shifted to an L2-based growth strategy, its more prudent to look at combined DAAs with the major L2s in addition to base layer addresses:


Through this lens, we can see that October was yet another month of growth. October 2024 generated 3.2 million DAAs spread out among Ethereum and the larger L2 networks - that was up 7% month over month and 190% over October 2023. The biggest driver of this address growth has primarily been Base (COIN) which accounted for 1.4 million of the 3.2 million DAAs in October. From a fee standpoint, nearly 96% of the total fees generated from the chains shown in the chart above came from Ethereum.


That figure came out to be $142.3 million in fees during the month of October. This was up 37% from $103.7 million in September and 56% from the $91.2 million in fees during October 2023. Given that the price of ETH ended October flat from a capital appreciation standpoint, the higher fees did bring down the network's fully diluted price to fees multiple to the lowest level in 6 months. Last year's average fully diluted P/F ratio for October was 210x fees. This year the average P/F ratio was 181x fees in October 2024.


Comparing Ethereum to other L1 networks, shows a network that is still ahead of insurgent smart contract chains like Solana (SOL-USD) or Toncoin (TON-USD) but one that remains behind the industry leader Tron (TRX-USD). All told, I think there are positive signs from Ethereum's ecosystem usage for the month of October. Beyond fees and DAAs, there was year over year growth in several additional metrics that I think are important for network health:
Source: Artemis (combined between Arbitrum, Base, Blast, Celo, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon zkEVM, Skroll, Starknet, zkSync Era, Zora)
I'm particularly encouraged by the growth in stablecoins and stablecoin transfer volume. Though I will note that we again see some of the fastest ecosystem growth happening on Base rather than mainnet or other L2s. The problem with scaling via L2s is the activity isn't necessarily adding value to ETH as an asset because less ETH is required to transfer on secondary chains rather than the primary layer. In my view, this has diminished the investment case for ETH and it's difficult to argue with what we're seeing from capital markets.

Capital Flow Data

The spot ETH ETFs in the United States continue to be a massive dud and I'll show that in a moment. But first, the global investment product capital flow story for Ethereum remains lackluster for 2024:
Source: CoinShares, as of October 25th
In the company's most recent report from October 28th, we see month to date outflow from Ethereum products in the face of $3.3 billion of positive flow into Bitcoin-related products and other assets. The year to date flow into ETH products is just $748 million. Certainly weighing on global investment demand is the the US market via spot ETFs:


Here we can see the total net flow for Ethereum ETFs continues to be a problem at negative $468 million and it's entirely due to ""fee flight"" out of Grayscale's ETHE fund. The table above shows over $3.1 billion in asset value has left ETHE since conversion from a closed fund to ETF. Adjusting the outflow to ETH rather than dollars really tells the tale though:


The chart above shows 2.93 million ETH tokens held via ETHE when spot products were approved in the United States. That holding total is now down to 1.59 million ETH held through ETHE. Without strong demand for Ethereum through other ETFs, the net impact is negative and that further depresses the price of ETH. This is generally not new.
However, I do want to point out that the total ETH held through these products was 2.74 million at the end of the September and 2.74 million at the end of October as well. So even as investors continue to leave ETHE due to the 2.5% management fee, October's net flow story measured in ETH was flat. Coupled with the promising signs from fees on-chain and usage growth, it's possible the worst is over for ETH. But that's purely speculative on my part and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Risks



When it comes to monthly fees, Ethereum is indeed ahead of Solana but the lead is actually shrinking. At $73.9 million in monthly fees, Solana put in its strongest month ever based on that metric. It's quite clear that Ethereum's L2 chains still suffer from fragmentation and the broader ecosystem is battling numerous other L1 chains that offer cheap base layer fees and better transaction throughput. What remains to be seen is the degree to which ""switching costs"" will diminish the TAM of those competing L1 networks. But just because Ethereum has been a dominant L1 network historically, it does mean that ETH will command the second largest market capitalization forever.

Summary

I'm still of the view that Ethereum shouldn't be kicked to the curb by digital asset investors. There are certainly still headwinds including increasing competition from other blockchain ecosystems. But I suspect the cheaper, high throughput chains are better suited for the memecoins and high frequency trading. Ethereum maintains 48% of the entire crypto stablecoin market. If one believes stables are the ""killer app"" of public blockchains, then Ethereum still deserves a place in portfolios given its commanding head start in the segment. There are positive signs from both network usage and network valuation standpoints. ETHE fee flight remains a headwind as well. But it's clear the net outflow trend from ETH ETFs has been slowing down. October was a good month for Ethereum and nobody noticed. I wouldn't personally express a 'long ETH' thesis through ETHE, but Ethereum is a 'buy' in my eyes.

 -  Liberty Global is spinning-off the Sunrise shares, that should unlock $10+ value per share.
 -  RemainCo is deeply undervalued but facing challenges of highly leveraged assets during the high-capex cycle focused on fiber and 5G to drive long-term returns.
 -  Once the Capex cycle is over, these assets have the potential to generate over $1 billion in annual FCF for Liberty Global, driving a huge upside in the share price.
 -  Post-spin-off, investors can choose between a stable, high dividend from Sunrise or the higher-risk/higher-upside RemainCo trading at a steep discount.


I’m writing the article to address concerns I’ve seen among Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA)(NASDAQ:LBTYB)(NASDAQ:LBTYK) investors. With Liberty Global stock still trading at a ""very low"" price a few days before the spin-off, investors worry that the market reflects weak prospects for the soon-to-be-spun-off Sunrise. The concern seems to be that Sunrise, which only accounts for ~20% of total Liberty Global's EBITDA, may not be as valuable as initially thought. But focusing on EBITDA here misses the bigger picture.
The question you should ask is: What’s the true value of Liberty Global's RemainCo after Sunrise spins off?
While Liberty's CEO, Mike Fries, likes to repeat that Sunrise only accounts for 20% of their EBITDA, I would like to remind you of the words of Charlie Munger, that every time he read the word EBITDA, he substituted it with ""Bullshit earnings."" I tend to agree with Charlie, as we investors can't buy bread at our tables with EBITDA. What we should care about is free cash flow (FCF) generation. While Sunrise is a small EBITDA contributor, it delivers a much larger portion of FCF, making it a true shining diamond"" in the portfolio.
In this article, I'll try to explain why Sunrise's value is more robust than investors fear and why the real risk lies within RemainCo's highly leveraged, high-Capex assets.
(This article is a follow-up to my previous write-up.)

Sunrise: Refined Jewel among Raw Stones

Before I get into the portfolio of Telcos, I would like to spotlight the controversial strategy that Liberty Global uses across its assets. Liberty has a unique approach that involves highly leveraging its operating assets and moving the capital upstream to the HoldCo level. The company uses a non-recourse debt structure that protects the HoldCo from the liabilities of individual assets. While Liberty is shielded, it places significant leverage burdens on Sunrise, VMO2, VodafoneZiggo (VZ), and Telenet and makes their FCF highly sensitive to movements of interest rates.
An example can be VMO2: While its 2024 projected FCF is ~£500MM, it still plans to upstream £850MM in cash distribution to its hungry shareholders Liberty Global and Telefonica (TEF). According to VMO2 Q3 earnings release, the company still can borrow another ~£1.4B, which can be upstreamed to its shareholders.
The graph provided in the FY2023 presentation provides us with the big picture. Sunrise operates in the most developed European market with nearly full 5G coverage. There is no need for high Capex, so it can now enjoy the strong stream of FCF, which will be paid to its shareholders. The opposite can be said about the remaining companies that operate in less rational markets with very high competition for every client and are in the middle of a high-Capex cycle rolling the fiber optic cables.
The Sunrise spin-off makes absolute sense. It is highly discounted inside Liberty Global's portfolio. The dividend paid next year (for 2024) will stand at ~CHF240MM ($276MM). This is paid from FCF before deleveraging from Liberty Global's $1.7B cash injection. After deleveraging and final synergies execution, we should soon see Sunrise's FCF at ~CHF410MM ($470MM). With a 70% guided payout ratio, that's $330M for dividends. With ~355M shares outstanding, it is 93 cents per share in yearly dividends while the company still spends for deleveraging.
For those saying that Sunrise's share price will stabilize at $6, beg a pardon, but that would be a 15% dividend yield from a stable company in the highest quality economy in the world. There are no double-digit yielding companies in Switzerland, and the closest peer, Swisscom (OTCPK:SWZCF), yields a 3.8% dividend. While initially, there will no doubt be pressure on the stock, it should stabilize close to the targeted $10-12 from analysts.

RemainCo: High Leverage and High-Capex

While Sunrise provides safety and reliable dividends, the remaining assets will stay highly leveraged with limited FCF generation in a high-Capex cycle that is not optional, in my view. Capex investments in fiber optic cables and 5G are necessary if these companies want to survive the competition. This is not just a switch to another higher technology: in the industry, the fiber is called a ""Future-Proof"" technology based on glass or plastic fibers sending light signals at the speed of light. This technology allows users to stream 8k videos live in virtual reality and meet other futuristic requirements from consumers.
I believe investors must understand at least the basics of fiber technology. The old and still widely used technology is called DOCSIS (Data Over Cable), which uses a copper cable. Even the most modern DOCSIS solutions offer ""theoretical"" upload/download speeds of 5Gbs/10Gbs, which is incomparable to fiber optics speed of 40Gbs/1Tbs. As stated by AT&T (T), ""With symmetrical uploads and downloads, faster speeds, lower latency, higher reliability, field-proven business-grade technology, and higher customer satisfaction scores, fiber wins every time.""
Before we dig into each company, let me draw the ownership structure for a better understanding:
With the Sunrise out of the holding, the goal is clear now: Polish the stones into diamonds, deleverage them, and sell or spin them off.

Virgin Media O2 (VMO2)

VMO2 is currently undergoing a high investment cycle, positioning itself to capture the market share through fiber and 5G. Both JV owners Liberty Global and Telefonica withdraw substantial dividends from the company. The plan is to challenge the UK market leader BT Group (OTCPK:BTGOF), and that is why VMO2 restructured itself into ServCo and NetCo. NetCos usually bear higher valuations, and VMO2 plans to use it to potentially issue new equity to boost the fiber rollout. This step might dilute the Liberty Global shareholders, but if done on reasonable valuation, it might also be value-accretive.
For the valuation of VMO2, we would have to estimate the potential FCF after the Capex cycle. VMO2 doesn't offer long-term guidance, but after observing the BT Group, I see that the companies seem very similar and are in the same Capex cycle. VMO2 is guiding for FCF of ~£500MM with revenue of ~£10.5B. This gives you an FCF margin of ~5%. BT Group's FCF margin currently stands at ~6%, while the post-Capex cycle margin is expected to increase up to 11-12%. I believe that VMO2 in 2028 after the planned fiber rollout is finished, has the potential for similar margins. Though more leveraged so that the margin could reach 10%. With stable revenue, VMO2 could be making over £1B ($1.3B) of FCF, of which 50% would belong to Liberty Global shareholders.

VodafoneZiggo (VZ)

VZ operates in the Netherlands, which might be the most competitive European market. VZ has nearly half of its customer base subscribed to both fixed-line and mobile services, which helps them to lower the churn rate.
The issue for VZ is very high competition from KPN (OTCPK:KKPNF) and T-Mobile Netherlands with their Fiber offerings. VZ offers a cheaper alternative with a connection via coaxial cable, which comes with 1 gigabit speed. While the speed is currently fast enough for the common customer, this is definitely not ""Future-proof."" VZ is losing its customers (-4.8% YoY) and has offset the falling revenue by increasing the prices. It is doing well in its mobile segment, growing (+5.5% YoY). Overall, it is the ugly business of the portfolio, in my opinion, but it still makes around €300MM with ~7% FCF margin. I believe that this margin is in danger due to the competition of fiber and could shrink to an uncomfortable 2-3% in the future. Liberty Global has a plan in place to structure VZ into ""Liberty Global Benelux"" together with Telenet, which could help to utilize synergies, but it remains to be seen.

Telenet

Telenet, fortunately, operates in a more stable Belgian market than VZ. It is established as a key player. Similar to VMO2, it is positioning itself for future growth via fiber build-out and upgrade of its 5G network. Currently, with an FCF guidance of €250MM, the margin stays at 8-9%, where analysts expect the margins to slightly improve, post-Capex cycle, to 9-10%, reaching FCF of ~ €275MM in the near future.

Sum Of The Parts

In my opinion, the value of Sunrise is clear. It is the only polished gem of the portfolio, and I continue to value its share at ~$10+ per single Liberty share.
Management again provided a simple view of the valuation on the chart below. In my previous article, I valued the companies based on the EV/EBITDA multiples of their subsidiaries. I also recently found an article from Reuters that attempted to do the same.
Of course, as a long-term investor, I care about FCF and not so much about EBITDA, so I expect the post-Capex RemainCo to be providing FCF:
These companies have the potential to provide over $1B of yearly free cash flow to Liberty Global. With the RemainCo market cap of $3.6B, this would make for a 28% FCF yield. Not to mention HoldCos net cash of ~$2.1B and portfolio of growing assets valued ~$3B.

Conclusion

Investors will soon face a decision about whether they want to keep their Sunrise shares or reinvest in Liberty Global's remaining companies. While RemainCo offers a much higher upside, it also faces more risks from the high leverage of its subsidiaries. The shares of Liberty Global still trade at a substantial discount and offer a high margin of safety. The pressure on Sunrise shares right after the spin-off might be strong, but I believe that when the dust settles, it will be clear that this spin-off helped to unlock a great amount of value.

 -  This election is on track to potentially be the closest in 148 years, and lots of investors are nervous that volatility is about to explode higher.
 -  60-40 is a low volatility portfolio strategy, but JEPI is a 7% yielding, monthly income ETF alternative.
 -  JEPI's superior yield, income growth, and volatility profile make it a potentially wonderful ultra-yield choice ahead of this election.
 -  It provides superior stock selection, and ELNs generate far better income than most covered call ETFs.
 -  As long as you understand the limitations and downsides of ETFs like these, JEPI could be a superior choice, with higher yield, lower volatility, and better long-term income growth and total returns than a 60-40 portfolio.

Bottom Line Up Front: (NYSEARCA:JEPI) Is A Great Low Volatility, High-Yield Monthly Paying ETF Alternative To A 60/40
The stock market is on fire this year; that's no surprise.
But it's not just stocks that have been red hot in the past year.
Besides long bonds, which had a good year until the recent 0.6% spike in bond yields, every asset class is up this year.
Potentially The Closest Election in 148 Years
The Economist election model estimates a 270-268 electoral college race, the closest election in decades.
270 is the bare minimum needed to win the presidency.
The last time a candidate won with the bare minimum of electoral votes was in 1876 when Rutherford B. Hayes defeated Samuel Tilden by securing precisely 185 electoral votes out of 369 (50.14% of electoral votes).
Or, to put it another way, if the Economist is right and Harris were to win 270 electoral votes (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan), this would be the closest election in 148 years.

Why You Should Never, Ever ""Sit Out Elections Until The Dust Settles""

While passions are high, all long-term investors must remember three things.
US Companies Are Very Good At Managing Long-term Risk (Including Political and Regulatory Risk)
(Source: S&P, Dividend Kings Zen Research Terminal)
Adapting your portfolio to political uncertainty is one thing. Sitting out the market entirely until your side wins is another.
OK, but what if you just can't help yourself? What if you need to control volatility to sleep well at night?
Asset allocation is the answer for most investors in managing their long-term maximum declines.
This manner of managing emotions and ""frequency of return risk"" (becoming a forced seller at the worst time) is why the 60-40 stock/bond retirement portfolio is so popular.
Thanks to ETFs, you can buy 60-40 or similar-style target date funds at relatively low cost, making investing more accessible than ever.

3 Reasons JEPI Might Be A Superior Alternative To The 60-40

So, let's examine why JPMorgan's Premium Equity Income (JEPI) ETF, one of the most popular ultra-yield, monthly paying ETFs, is a potentially superior alternative to a 60-40.

How JEPI Works (And Why Income Investors Love It)

JEPI offers much more attractive income than most traditional strategies, courtesy of its intelligent, covered call strategy.
It uses exchanged linked notes, which are a similar though different approach to generating income.
The long-term average (since 2008) ELN option yield is 8%.
The higher the market's volatility, the higher the option yield income.
You can see how the yield generated is superior to traditional covered calls.
JEPI uses ELNs to synthetically mimic the payoff profile of a covered call strategy rather than directly writing covered call options.

The Secret Sauce Behind JEPI (How ELNs Work)

Equity-Linked Notes (ELNs) are financial instruments that JEPI uses to generate income, similar to a covered call strategy, but with some key differences:
For income investors, the key takeaway is that ELNs allow JEPI to generate high levels of income (often yielding over 10% annually) while potentially reducing some of the complexities and risks associated with traditional covered call strategies.
While this is not a risk-free yield, counterparty risk is the primary downside, and JPM is selling ELNs to Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC).
In other words, the strongest institutions in America, and if JEPI's ELN income ever fails, the economy will be so bad it won't matter what your portfolio income is doing.
Rather than write covered calls on the entire portfolio (as most covered call ETFs do), JEPI writes ELNs for 15% of the portfolio and then keeps 85% exposure to low volatility, a blue-chip portfolio that their experienced management team selects.
JEPI screens companies for volatility and earnings volatility and then weighs them based on earnings stability and price volatility.
JEPI's portfolio isn't designed to mimic the S&P because its goal is to generate 35% of the market's volatility with 80% of its historical returns.

Potentially Superior Long-Term Returns And Income Growth

6% to 10% long-term returns are what management has designed JEPI to achieve.

Total Returns Since 2018

JEPIX is the institutional mutual fund version of JEPI, but the same managers run both and use the same strategy. JEPIX has been around for two years longer than JEPI.
You can see how JEPI's strategy has delivered the expected returns management is guiding for and beaten a 60-40.
Not just outperforming but delivering 33% better negative volatility-adjusted returns (Sortino ratio).
Adjusted for inflation, JEPI has been beating a 60-40 consistently since its inception.
In 66% of the years (so far), JEPI has beaten the 60-40.
Remember how JEPI is designed for 35% lower volatility than the S&P? Its historical beta is 0.64, 36% lower.
That's similar to the 60/40s but with superior returns, including volatility-adjusted returns.
For example, historically, alpha, or volatility-adjusted S&P outperformance, is 0.3% compared to the 60/40s -2% in the same period.
JEPI has delivered 11% excess returns vs risk-free bonds for every unit of volatility, compared to 8% for a 60-40.
Income Profile Per $1,000 Invested In 2018
(Source: Portfolio Visualizer)
JEPI's yield on cost (adjusted for inflation) is 9% for investors who bought when JEPIX first came out.
That's more than 2X better than the 60-40, but more importantly, it's delivered over 2X the inflation-adjusted income.
JEPI has delivered nearly 60% of an investor's initial investment in inflation-adjusted dividends and 71% in nominal (non-inflation-adjusted) terms in just six years.

A Great Low Volatility ETF

Negative S&P Years
(Source: Portfolio Visualizer Premium)
When the market is down (at least since 2018), JEPI is down about 3X less and less than half of the decline in the 60-40s.
Positive S&P Years
(Source: Portfolio Visualizer Premium)
JEPI's historical annual returns show 33% of the market's downside in year when stocks fall and half the markets gains when stocks rise.
That's to be expected since ELNs, like covered calls, cap the upside, and stocks don't go up 10% per year.
In other words, stocks are more likely to be up 20%-plus in a year than down any amount.
This is the downside of Buffer funds, which cap upside at high single digits and buffer the downside.
Long term, it's a bad deal.
But if the goal is high yield, paid monthly, with low volatility?

S&P 5% Or Greater Monthly Declines

(Source: Portfolio Visualizer Premium)
In the market's worst months (10% worst months) when stocks fall 5% or more, the average decline for the S&P was 8%.
JEPI and a 60-40 both fell significantly less but JEPI's ELN based strategy is capable of superior long-term income growth and returns.

Best 5% of Monthly Returns Since 2018

(Source: Portfolio Visualizer Premium)
Since 2018
Since inception JEPI has captured 61% of the S&P's upside in a rising market compared to 59% for a 60-40.
When the market was falling it captured 65% of the downside while a 60-40 captured 70%.
Higher upside in good times, lower downside in bad times, and higher yield all the time.
Risk Profile: Why JEPI Isn't Right For Everyone
There are two essential things that JEPI investors need to know before buying it.
(Source: Morningstar)
JEPI's tax expense ratio is almost 4% historically, meaning about 30% of its returns go to the IRS in taxable accounts.
That's because option income, like from covered calls (or exchanged linked notes), is taxed at ordinary income tax rates.
The highest earners can pay over 40% tax rates on covered call income. That's because of the 3.8% ACA surcharge.
And don't forget state taxes.
Also, remember that some cities or counties tax income, too (most states treat dividends as income).
The Highest Tax Rates In The Country: NYC For Highest Income Earners
This is why rich people in NYC buy individual properties and don't own REITs in taxable accounts.
The same rules apply for JEPI or any similar ETF (or bond ETFs, which are all taxed at top marginal income tax rates)
What about JEPI beating the 60-40 in the future?
It's designed to deliver 8% long-term returns, 1% more than the 60-40's historical returns.
However, the new consensus (from Morningstar and FactSet consensus estimates) for the 60-40 is not 7%.
In other words, beating the 60-40 might be a lot more challenging in the future, assuming current long-term expectations from analysts and economists and the bond market prove accurate.

Bottom Line: For High-Yield and Low Volatility ETFs, JEPI Is One Of The Best Buys This Election Season

The election is a coin flip, which means potentially wild economic policy divergences are coming in 2025.
In the next week, we could see significant volatility in stocks and bonds.
JEPI offers a potentially attractive alternative to the standard 60-40.
While it's not a perfect ETF (no ETF is), for those who understand how JEPI works and its pros and cons, this is a potentially great way to harness the genius of US capitalism to generate significant income and potentially fund a rich retirement.

 -  Charter's earnings report showed much lower ACP broadband losses than expected, hence the 12% market rally.
 -  ACP losses may not end in Q4 as management projects.
 -  Spectrum Mobile showed continued strength and may become even more profitable than expected.
 -  Charter's new Video strategy has potential, but today management disclosed yet another unforced error in the transition.
 -  Without meaningful reductions in Video content spending, which are not on current track, Charter's Video reboot may die stillborn.


Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) reported its Q3 earnings today before market open, and the market has reacted very positively, bidding the stock up 12% at market close.
Ordinarily, when it comes to large companies like Charter, I prefer to write deep dives on one or two aspects of its operations. This is going to be a little different. Ordinarily there are only one or two real nuggets of new information in an earnings report and the rest is sort of boilerplate. Here, Charter gave us new insights on a variety of issues. So I’m going to try to hit everything at least a little.

Cord-Cutting

Yes, I know that most investors don’t really care anymore since Video profit margins have, at least according to the accountants, whittled down to practically nothing. As I detailed in my last article, that perception isn’t quite accurate; Video actually generates spillover benefits to the broadband side that are larger than commonly perceived.
Charter reported Video subscribers declined by 294,000 in Q3 as compared to 327,000 last year. That looks like an improvement, until you realize that Charter also disclosed previously that 100,000 of those ’23 losses were ESPN-blackout related. It’s business as usual loss was 227,000. This year’s blackout-free number was up compared to that.
Even if you wanted to ignore the blackout effect, Charter’s Video losses only declined 10%. If you consult their prior year figures on their earnings report you will see that the size of the customer base is also down 10% year over year, so in percentage terms there was no improvement.

The Ongoing ""Remake The Bundle"" Initiative

Charter’s video losses are disappointing in light of the fact that unlike other video providers, it is recommitting to the Video bundle rather than disengaging from it. Charter has spent the past year securing new content deals with all of its major media partners to include the ad-supported tiers of their streaming services in Charter’s pay-TV bundle. The whole point of doing that was to improve the value proposition and reduce churn. There is no sign so far that it is succeeding.
As I explained last article, the reason almost certainly has to do with the structure of Charter’s offering. Charter began by offering ad-supported services, which couldn’t be upgraded to ad-free without forfeiting the Charter discount. That’s absurd, and not surprisingly, early uptake of Charter’s offers was extremely low.
Charter is now pivoting. It was good to hear CEO Chris Winfrey on the conference call explicitly call out facilitating ad-free upgrades as one of the pivotal steps in Charter’s journey to completing its new video offering. Winfrey made it sound like he’s known that all along and everything’s going to plan; frankly, it more appears to me that Winfrey didn’t realize that initially. But now he has and he is working furiously to pivot.
Regardless, Winfrey has indicated that by early next year, the company will have largely completed its ad-free portals and will also have better integrated the apps themselves into Charter’s video architecture. At that point Charter will also begin mass-marketing streaming apps to its broadband-only households, which it has not yet done, and which it takes a commission on. Though neither side will say how much it is.
So 2025 will be the real rubber and road year for Charter’s new Video strategy.

The Most Disappointing Part

However, there was another comment that was less auspicious. Although Charter has successfully secured streaming services for its bundle, it’s been hard to tell how much it pays for the privilege. As I’ve written before, we are almost certainly not even at, but well past the maximum Video subscribers are prepared to pay for service. Charter cannot spend more on programming; rather, it must become more efficient in how it spends.
So it’s not much help if Charter is securing these streaming services only by paying full freight for them, even at wholesale rates. It needs to cut Video costs, either by reducing rates for linear channels, or by basically getting streaming for free.
The latter is not entirely unrealistic. Charter is the largest cable video provider in the country and a crucial partner for media companies. It has leverage. Especially in the recent Charter deal with Warner (WBD) because David Zaslav had absolutely no leverage there. Not only was Warner losing the NBA, but it turned out that both Comcast and Charter, the “Spartan Kings of Pay-TV” as I’ve dubbed them, had distribution deals with Turner that expired right after the last NBA game on Turner.
I can’t imagine Zaslav’s reaction when he found out about that. Media executives are paid good money to make sure that never, ever happens. Because the way media companies win blackout fights against distributors is by getting by with the money from other deals while the dispute is going on. Having your two biggest distributors go dark simultaneously would have been absolutely catastrophic.
So when Charter said it wanted to renegotiate a year early and take double-blackout risk off the table, it should have left Zaslav on the back foot. Instead, Zaslav secured a deal which saw no reduction in TNT’s $3 a month affiliate fee, and the usual increase for all the others. The only concession was the usual incorporation of Max and discovery+ into the video bundle.
I wrote before that the Max wholesale rate was probably where Charter got its concessions. But now I’m not so sure. On the earnings call, Winfrey had this to say
That is quite alarming. It sounds more like he gave Max a strong wholesale rate and declined to go for the jugular because he wants Warner to support Charter in its new Video operations.

Another Unforced Winfrey Error On Video

I may be over-reading it. But if true, it is not only mistaken, it is a grave error. In the first place, Warner was already fully committed to supporting Charter’s bundle. I think Warner, more than any other company, cannot survive without the linear bundle. Even Disney’s (DIS) exposure to it is not as high. Winfrey could have held Zaslav up for completely free Max and a free private jet as a sweetener, and Zaslav still would have had no choice but to do everything possible to make sure Charter’s Video bundle was a success. Winfrey already has Zaslav’s complete commitment and doesn’t have to buy it twice.
More to the point, it is a generosity Charter simply cannot afford. Even with its new strategy in place, almost certainly going forward Video prices will have to go down, not up. Charter’s focus must be on driving the hard bargains necessary to bring content costs down sufficiently to make the business sustainable. Even if a media CEO’s loyalty to the bundle needs to be bought, and assuming it is worth anything, it almost certainly is not worth the savings Charter has repeatedly passed up to buy it.
Charter cannot afford these mistakes, especially considering the “no ad-free upgrade” errors it already made. This was one of the most disappointing aspects of the call for me.

Broadband Business

I’ve spent a lot of time on Video because I think its importance is underestimated, though I know that view is not widely shared. Readers may be glad to see me move on to broadband.
Charter lost 110,000 broadband subscribers. That’s actually an improvement from the 149,000 last quarter. Q3 is usually stronger because college students go back to their dorms and reactivate their separate accounts. But since broadband is where everyone expects Charter to make their money, the loss was still disappointing.
Charter’s broadband losses are less scary, however, when taken in the context of the expiring Affordable Connectivity Program, which ran out of funding in the middle of the second quarter. Charter management has indicated that they have - I guess now the proper tense is had - over 5 million ACP Internet subscribers on their rolls. Of Q2’s losses, over 100k of them were attributed to the program's expiration - and management indicated that those were only voluntary churn; the non-pay disconnects hadn’t even started yet.
In that context, Charter’s broadband number was if anything a relief. Management says that ACP represented another 200k broadband losses this quarter, which means that net adds actually would have been positive but for the program’s loss. There will be another 100k next quarter but after that management expects ACP to be behind them.
That represents only 8-10% loss of ACP customers, which obviously came as a relief to the market given the reaction of the stock.

Is ACP Really Behind Us?

I wonder about the ACP projections. Consider the essential nature of Internet access in today’s society. Even if you no longer have the money to pay for it, you’re not going to start going without it a moment sooner than you absolutely have to.
It is for this reason that, while I agree that the broadband numbers this quarter were not as bad as feared, I am uncertain how much of that is an overestimation of final losses and how much of it is just a bit of premature timing. It may very well still be that final ACP losses turn out to be as bad as feared, and the losses are simply more backloaded than we expected.
To be sure ACP will end this year, management would have to be certain that anyone who can’t afford Internet will let it go by the end of the year. Given how essential it has become, it wouldn’t surprise me if people fought to hold on a little longer than that, before ultimately capitulating to the inevitable.
To be sure, Charter is in no danger of losing 5 million subscribers, or anywhere near. Management has indicated before that the majority of their ACP customers are pre-existing relationships, customers who were already buying internet from Charter before ACP existed, and a lot of them are paying for upgraded internet over the ACP $30 minimum, suggesting that they have disposable income with which to purchase Internet access with or without government help.

Spectrum Mobile

At the other end of the scale, the best news for Charter hands down has been its wireless growth. Charter added another 545,000 Spectrum Mobile subscribers in Q3 and is now rapidly approaching the 10 million threshold. Spectrum Mobile broke the $800 million quarterly revenue line for the first time and is profitable on a standalone basis.
One thing we did not get is an update on CBRS. Assuming that remains on track, Charter mobile profit should grow even faster going forward. Currently, Charter supports its mobile customers in two ways: it routes as much traffic as possible over its own integrated hotspots where its network is available, and then it supplements with a Verizon roaming deal. Charter reported that its mobile network data usage is only 13% Verizon currently, and management believes it can get that down by another third or so by deploying CBRS small cells.
Because CBRS deployment is a fixed cost, it hasn’t been profitable for Charter to do it until it reaches a certain critical mass. At 10 million, however, that point is almost certainly fast approaching. We don’t know the exact wholesale rate for a GB of data on Verizon’s network Charter pays, but historically Charter and other cable MVNO operators pay as much as 70% of their total wireless costs in network charges to their owner-operator partners.
70% for 13% of the traffic. Getting big enough to make CBRS profitable and worthwhile to deploy should be a big boost to Charter’s bottom line. Since we don’t know Charter’s exact mobile cost breakdown, we can’t say for sure how much, but it should be significant.

Investment Summary

This has been, of necessity, a somewhat off the cuff article, which I usually don’t like. We’ve all had less than a day to digest all the things Charter told us. But my initial reaction is that Charter did report some good news on the ACP and mobile fronts. The market’s reaction is not surprising.
I have two lingering questions: is 2024 really the end of ACP losses, and is Winfrey’s abject failure to get the best deal from Warner indicative of Charter’s Video strategy going forward?
It wasn’t a bad report, by any means, but I’m staying Neutral on Charter for now.

 -  TTEC Holdings, Inc. reports the experience of many decades for working in the global customer experience industry.
 -  TTEC will most likely enjoy net sales growth because the AI market is an emerging market, and the demand for the AI services is growing.
 -  It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the total number of employees works from home, which could bring significant FCF margin growth.
 -  The company's EV/ FWD EBITDA stands at close to 6x, and the price/ FWD cash flow is close to 2.3x.


TTEC Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTEC) runs a proven business model based on international recruiting efforts and large clients from many industries. Thanks to the innovative technologies such as chatbots, AI, and GenAI tools, in my view, the company will most likely report free cash flow in the future. In my opinion, considering previous free cash flow growth and net income growth, TTEC appears significantly undervalued. My DCF model implied a target price of close to $97 per share. There are obvious risks from failed partnerships or failed recruiting strategies, however I think that the current stock is too cheap at its current price mark.

TTEC: Diversification, Artificial Intelligence, And Other Growing Markets

TTEC Holdings, Inc. reports the experience of many decades for working in the global customer experience industry. Equipped with digital solutions with data-driven tools and a lot of know-how accumulated, in my opinion, the company offers many services that customers demand in today's world.
TTEC reports close to 750 clients from very different industries including the financial industry, healthcare, public sector, technology, and media among others. In my view, diversification may help TTEC Holdings deliver mores solid revenue growth than other small and less diversified competitors.
Among the different business segments, there is TTEC Digital, which offers contact center as a service, customer relationship management, artificial intelligence, and analytics. In my opinion, AI will most likely offer a competitive advantage over other competitors. Besides, TTEC will most likely enjoy net sales growth because the AI market is an emerging market, and the demand for the AI services is growing. The company discussed this market and recent demand for automation needs in the last annual report.
I bought shares long time ago. I am a long-term shareholder. However, I may buy some more shares before the new quarterly release. From Q3 2020 to Q3 2023, the company always reported better than expected EPS. With this in mind, TTEC may deliver better than expected figures, which may make the stock price increase.
With that about the coming quarter, I identified several potential EPS catalysts. Most analysts are expecting double digit EPS growth in 2025, and 2026. However, it is worth understanding why EPS may grow in the future.

TTEC Hires Everywhere And Serves Large Clients, Which Looks Like A EPS Driver

In my view, TTEC knows well how to acquire talent everywhere in the world, and connects these trained employees with large organizations, which looks like a fantastic capacity. Given the number of jurisdictions in which the company could operate, business growth appears impressive. In the last annual report, TTEC reported close to 60k employees working from Asia, America, and the EMEA region. It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the total number of employees works from home, which could bring significant FCF margin growth. The annual report offers a significant amount of information about these matters.

Strategies That Worked For Many Years Could Also Work In The Future

In my opinion, further deepening client relationships, executing geographic market expansion, and conducting new investment in tech-driven innovation will continue to bring significant revenue growth in the coming years. TTEC executed some of these relationships in the United States and some other jurisdictions. If these strategies have worked in some countries, similar strategies in new jurisdictions will most likely work. Besides, given previous financial performance, TTEC does look like a proven business model.

Net Income Growth, And Free Cash Flow Growth

Recently, TTEC reported a significant decrease in net income, and recent quarterly reports could be better than expected. With that, in my view, the company's net income reported in the last ten years clearly indicates that TTEC runs a profitable business model. I used these numbers to make my projections about future net income growth.
With regard to FCF growth, it is worth noting that FCF increased significantly from 2014. Even if the company reports lower free cash flow in 2024 and 2025, I see future free cash flow potential. As soon as more investors study the company's financial statements, in my opinion, the stock price will most likely grow to reflect a bit more the company's free cash flow.

Increase In The Total Amount Of Cash, Goodwill And Assets, And Limited Amount Of Debt

In my view, the balance sheets reported from 2014 show significant business success and a business model that works well. The company notes an increase in the total amount of cash and total amount of assets, which appear driven by acquisitions. The total amount of goodwill also increased significantly. Given the company's ability to acquire other companies, I would expect that further inorganic growth will be a driver for revenue growth and net income growth.
The total amount of liabilities and long-term debt also increased from 2014 to 2023. With that, with somewhat stable EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow, in my view, the total amount of debt does not seem that significant. I would not worry about the total amount of net debt. In this regard, it is worth noting that the company does not seem to pay significantly high interest rates. In 2023, the interest accrued at a rate of approximately 6.7%. With this in mind, I used a WACC of about 6% in my financial model.

My Valuation Target: $97 Per Share

Given previous free cash flow growth, my own assumptions, FCF drivers, and net revenue drivers noted previously, I designed a projection of future free cash flow growth. My numbers range from $201 million in 2024 to $252 million in 2030. I also used a discount of 6% and a Gordon growth model with 2% long term growth. The implied total enterprise value is close to $5.5 billion. Besides, I obtained a total equity valuation of $4.5 billion and a target price of $97 per share.
In my view, TTEC does know that the shares are quite cheap right now. There is a stock repurchase program in place, so TTEC may buy shares in the coming quarters. It is worth noting that TTEC, for some reasons, did not buy shares in the past.
TTEC also appears to trade significantly undervalued as compared to peers. The company trades at 5x-6x Non-GAAP FWD earnings. According to Seeking Alpha, the sector median PE Non-GAAP FWD stands at close to 20x.
The company's EV/ FWD EBITDA stands at close to 6x, and the price/ FWD cash flow is close to 2.3x. In sum, the company is quite cheap. Other peers trade at about 15x FWD cash flow.

A Client Decided To Stop Working With TTEC

In the last annual report, TTEC reported that a large financial services client decided to stop working with one of the company's business lines. I cannot really know whether the loss of this client will bring a significant drop in net sales in 2024 and 2025. However, there are risks coming from further clients deciding to stop their relationships with TTEC. Shareholders may want to keep in mind these risks that may deteriorate future financial statements, and push the company's price down.

Risks From AI

TTEC offers a number of AI and GenAI tools to work with clients. TTEC believes that many of the tasks currently performed by employees may soon be executed by chatbots as well as AI and GenAI tools.
In my opinion, these technologies could bring a significant amount of FCF margin growth in the coming years, but could also damage the total target markets. If competitors lower their prices, TTEC may have to do so, which could bring a significant decrease in net income growth. The company discussed further risks that new technologies could bring in the last annual report.

Risks From Failed Partnerships

TTEC obtains a significant amount of revenue thanks to partnership agreements with providers of customer management technology solutions. The partners present TTEC's solutions to their clients. Hence, the company's future revenue growth depends on whether TTEC can maintain these relationships. In my view, any losses or damages arising from system outages and cybersecurity incidents may deteriorate the relationships TTEC has with clients and partners. As a result, in my view, failed partnerships could bring revenue growth and free cash flow down.
It is also worth noting that lack of innovation or any failure to meet the expectations of clients may also bring a number of problems. In the last annual report, the company noted that it may have to face liabilities from failed operations.

Risks From Failed Recruiting Strategies

TTEC makes a substantial amount of money thanks to its ability to hire everywhere in the world. TTEC's business model is labor intensive. With this in mind, in my opinion, failed hiring techniques and lack of qualified personnel with multi-lingual capabilities may deteriorate future revenue growth. As a result, in my opinion, we could see declines in future free cash flow expectations and the stock price declines.

The Chairman And CEO Owns A Significant Amount Of Shares

The CEO owns a significant amount of shares, and pretty much controls the company. It means that he may make certain decisions that may be in his best interests, but may go against the interests of shareholders.
He could even block acquisition attempts from other competitors. In this regard, it is worth noting that a few days ago the CEO noted that it may buy the company for $6.85.

Conclusion

With a business model that has been tested in many jurisdictions and is based on recruiting strategies, executing geographic market expansion, and tech-driven innovation, TTEC will most likely enjoy revenue growth. In my opinion, further investments in chatbots, AI, and GenAI tools could significantly accelerate business growth, and enhance the FCF margin growth. Given previous financial performance and free cash flow growth, I do not think the current valuation is fair at all. My discounted cash flow model, which was based on conservative and realistic assumptions about future free cash flow implied a valuation of $97 per share. Even considering risks from failed partnerships or failed recruiting strategies, TTEC appears quite cheap at the current stock price.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732382-sell-nvidia-on-the-dji-bounce,4732382,Sell Nvidia On The DJI Bounce,"Summary

 -  Nvidia's share price has bounced from ETF buying demand based on its DJI inclusion.
 -  The company is heavily overvalued and doesn't have a great path to maintain sales let alone grow.
 -  Fundamentally, we expect the company to face threats to its margins and struggle to compete.
 -  I am The Value Portfolio, an experienced analyst specializing in stock research and wealth growth. I run the investing group The Retirement Forum where I focus on ideas to prepare you for retirement.


Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up after hours on news that the company will be replacing Intel (INTC) in the DJI. That could push the company back up to almost 52-week highs as the company's share price has continued to run-up on minimal news. Despite that, we've been largely bearish on the company. As we'll see throughout this article, the company's largest customers are looking for efficiency.
With growth becoming more predictable in the industry, we expect unreachable exuberance to exit from the company's share price, hurting future shareholder returns.

AMD Threat

Nvidia is facing competitive threats, not just to volumes, but additionally to the company's margins.


Meta, which as we'll discuss below is one of Nvidia's largest customers, is committed to open source models. In late-July 2024, the company launched its 405B model described as:
Now there's two parts of model running, training and predicting and Nvidia is a very major player in training. However, bigger isn't always better for models, as we expect in the long-term the parade of new models will slowdown. Instead, existing models that are ""good enough"" will be used.
Meta, one of Nvidia's largest customers, running its cutting edge model exclusively on AMD GPUs is a major risk for 2 reasons.
(1) It shows weakness in Nvidia's moat. The company, for running models, doesn't have any products that simply have no competitors. AMD is clearly capable of sustaining traffic.
(2) AMD GPUs are apparently cheaper to run. That's not surprising AMD in its two leading segments has consistently had lower margins than Intel and Nvidia for CPUs and GPUs respectively.
However, we expect the combination of the two to lead to what we expect to be one of Nvidia's biggest headwinds. Nvidia's massive profit from GPUs was partially driven by growth in their margins. The company's margins appear to have peaked, which is the first sign of slowing down demand in our view. Having to compete with AMD could result in even lower margins.
That could fundamentally stop the company from ever justifying its valuation.

Customer Efficiency and Concentration

Meta is tied as one of Nvidia's top 2 customers for its H100 GPUs and that concentration maintains a threat.


As of today, the vast majority of Nvidia's revenue comes from its datacenter business. And that datacenter business sees the vast majority of its revenue from a handful of customers. That means that the company's required revenue growth, which we will discuss below, need to come from this handful of customers. That's a major concern.
That's because not only does Nvidia have competitors from non model producing companies, such as AMD, but its largest customers are technical leaders. Several have larger engineering staffs and R&D than Nvidia itself does. Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) is quickly becoming a leader in custom silicon, and won training deals with Apple, one of the largest companies at delivering AI to customers.
Google is also building its own models with the TPUs, enabling strong synergies, as it flexes its software development might. Open AI has 3.5k employees to Google's 170k and Google has said its largest focus in AI. Nvidia has <30k employees. Microsoft (MSFT) is building its own processors as well, and Amazon (AMZN), which works with many smaller companies in AI with AWS, already has cost-leading options.
This competition from its largest customers, who work directly with the end models, unlike Nvidia, could place a massive threat to Nvidia's margins. Nvidia's margins have grown from incredible demand for its GPUs, and that's the primary driver of profits.
Additionally, Nvidia's valuation is so lofty that Nvidia doesn't need just maintained revenue and profits it needs growing revenue and profits. With Nvidia's largest customers spending much of their capital with Nvidia and concerns over overspending among largest tech companies, maintaining let alone growing spending could be tough.


More existentially, artificial intelligence is known for coming in waves, as those in the 60s might recall from the movies indicating that today we'd have general artificial intelligence everywhere we go. LLMs are not AGI and there are some that are already indicating a potential AI winter. Hitting a wall for LLMs, one not even seen yet, could present an existential threat.

Modeling Nvidia's Share Price Exuberance

A lack of beating expectations in Nvidia's recent earnings caused the company to have the largest single-day market cap decline of any company in history.


Since then, the company's market cap has trended back up towards records of $3.3+ trillion. That matches the cycle we're seeing, where the company will take a hit after tangible results, and then slowly recover as exuberance drifts back in. At some day, now or in the future Nvidia needs to justify a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion.
Not only that, but with historic S&P 500 growth around 10%, if the company takes until 2030 to justify its valuation before it stops growing, it needs to justify a $6 trillion valuation not a $3.4 trillion. For our non-growing example we'll take the P/E of Intel pre-revamp at ~10. We can also use Apple's P/E of ~15 when the market was pessimistic about its growth.
We'll take the higher number of ~15x. That means Nvidia, by 2030, needs to hit $400 billion in annual profits.


Today the company is sitting at ~$120 billion in annual revenue and $65 billion in net income. The company recently increased its dividend to an incredibly small yield (0.3%) but it will cost the company $10 billion annualized. The company has announced a plan to maintain its dividend, which in our view, highlights the risk of increased competition.
We also expect the company's net margin to drop from ~55% currently to ~25% by 2030 as the industry becomes more mature. That's our midpoint expectation, we can see much more substantial drops if AI exuberance dies down, as discussed above. Still that would imply a need to grow revenue from $120 billion today towards $1.6 trillion.
That's 13.5x revenue growth in 6-years. That's almost 55% annualized revenue growth. While that's below the company's current revenue growth rate of 122% annualized, slowing down QoQ vs YoY revenue growth along with the law of large numbers will both present massive headwinds in our view. That will make it very difficult for the company to meet the views.

Thesis Risk

The largest risk to our thesis is that in the short-term the market is a voting machine. In the long-term, it's a weighing machine. Nvidia's share price is clearly being driven by exuberance, and for those who are betting against the company, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain liquid.
The second risk is that while we think generational AI is far way, a breakthrough could happen, that could increase demand for the company's GPUs. That could enable it to earn the cash flow to justify its valuation, which we don't see it as having a path to do right now.

Conclusion

For those looking to exit Nvidia, fortunately the market can remain irrational. However, at some point it's time to take profits. Even if you think Nvidia will continue its growth, we see it as unlikely that the company will be able to continue beating the growth of the S&P 500. Nvidia has a $3.4 trillion valuation and it needs substantial growth.
Nvidia's inclusion in the DJI, which will force ETF buying, potentially pushing the company back to all-time highs, is a great time to exit. Fundamentally, Nvidia has numerous risks. For those looking to bet against, options are a great way to do it with limited risk. Over the long-term though, we recommend against investing in Nvidia, expecting it to substantially underperform.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732380-first-quantum-minerals-strong-q3-shows-potential-beyond-cobre-panama,4732380,First Quantum Minerals: Strong Q3 Shows Potential Beyond Cobre Panama,"Summary

 -  First Quantum reported a strong Q3, with copper production rising 13% quarter-over-quarter despite Cobre Panama's suspension.
 -  Higher grades at Kansanshi and Sentinel reduced C1 cash costs by $0.16, strengthening margins, while gold production surged 20% QoQ, boosting revenue alongside resilient copper prices and record gold prices.
 -  Cobre Panama remains a key asset, with ongoing arbitration claims that could unlock significant upside. The market appears to be undervaluing the potential outcomes regarding the Cobre Panama mine closure.


Introduction

I previously covered First Quantum Minerals (OTCPK:FQVLF) (TSX:FM:CA) earlier this year where I gave the shares a buy rating for adventurous investors willing to be exposed to the uncertainty surrounding the company’s largest asset, the Cobre Panama Mine. Since then, the shares have fallen slightly, down 5.9% against the 2.5% rise experienced by the S&P 500 (SPX). This reflects the continued uncertainty surrounding the Cobre Panama mine which remains closed following a court decision in Panama. Earlier this month, the company reported its Q3 earnings, and narrowing its guidance towards the upper end of forecasts. In this article, I want to explore in more detail the company’s third quarter results, recent developments the company has experienced, and determine whether First Quantum remains a buy at its current price.

Q3 Results

First Quantum Minerals recently announced its results for Q3 2024, delivering total copper production of 116 thousand tonnes, a 13% increase over the previous quarter, however down 48% year over year due to the production suspension at the Cobre Panama Mine. Excluding the impact of the Cobre Panama mine, copper production increased production was up 4% year over year. C1 cash costs for the quarter came in at $1.57 per pound of copper, down $0.16 from the previous quarter due to higher production volumes, lower fuel costs, and increased gold by-product production.
The rise in copper output was driven by an increase in both throughput and grades across the Kansanshi and Sentinel mines. Kansanshi’s production was 49,810 tonnes in the quarter, up 20% from Q2 due to higher ore grades, with cash costs falling to $1.29 per pound. Sentinel reported production of 58,412 tonnes, up 9% from Q2, with C1 costs falling $0.08 to $1.86 per pound, reflecting increased throughput.
The company recorded a significant uplift in gold production to 32,000 ounces, up 20% quarter on quarter, driven by increased grades at the Kansanshi mine. Nickel production from the Enterprise mine was 4,867 tonnes, a decline from the second quarter but still up substantially year on year. Nevertheless, full year guidance remains at 17,000–20,000 tonnes of nickel as operations focus on boosting mining volumes.
With gold prices reaching a record high in the quarter, and the average gross realized copper price falling only slightly in the quarter to $4.24 per pound, revenue came in at $1.28 billion, up 4% compared to the second quarter, and beating expectations by $180 million. Adjusted earnings per share rose $0.16 quarter on quarter to $0.14 beating expectations of a $0.05 per share loss, benefiting increased production and cost efficiency. EBITDA came in at $520 million, a 55% increase from Q2, reflecting higher production volumes and lower C1 cash costs. Net debt slightly increased in the quarter, reaching $5,591 million, up $154 million due to planned capital expenditure on the Kansanshi mine expansion.
This strong quarterly performance means the company remains on track to meet or exceed its full year copper production guidance, with management updating its guidance of copper production of 400,000 to 420,000 tonnes for the year at the upper end of the initial guidance range. C1 cash cost guidance is now expected to come in at the lower end between $1.80 to $1.95 per pound. Additionally, gold production guidance was increased to 120,000 to 135,000 ounces, with the Kansanshi mine expected to sustain solid production levels.

Cobre Panama Developments

The suspension of mining at First Quantum’s Cobre Panama mine has been a significant setback for the company. Cobre Panama, producing around 350,000 tonnes of copper annually, had previously generated over a third of First Quantum's revenues, underpinning its financial importance to the company. I covered the story behind the closure in my previous article, but effectively the Panama Supreme Court declared the 2023 mining concession contract unconstitutional leading to the suspension of operations. Since then, the company has been unable to mine and is engaged in a preservation and safe management process at the site, costing around $13 million a month.
Following the closure, First Quantum has lodged a $20 billion arbitration claim under the Canada-Panama free trade agreement and another claim through the International Chamber of Commerce. This is expected to be a long process, with a decision on the International Chamber of Commerce claim not expected until September next year.
Given the 5% contribution to Panama’s GDP the mine made when operational, it is of significant importance to Panama’s economy. The new Panamanian president, José Raúl Mulino, has made clear his government will address the Cobre Panama mine as needed, but major issues will not be addressed until 2025 at the earliest. The new government also announced an audit of the project by international experts to establish a factual basis for any future decisions. However, local opposition and recent protests against the 2023 concession agreement, suggest that any renegotiation could meet substantial resistance.
The outcome remains contingent on the results of the government-led audit, arbitration proceedings, and ongoing negotiations. While the new administration appears more friendly to the Cobre Panama mine than his predecessor, the potential reopening is fraught with challenges. Whatever happens will take a prolonged period to resolve and also depend on how the public of Panama react. Despite this, I remain confident that a resolution will be reached, whether that be a re-opening, but likely on worst terms in the mining concession, or some form of compensation for First Quantum is achieved.

Other Developments

In other developments, the Kansanshi S3 expansion remains on track to begin production in the second half of 2025. The S3 expansion is expected to deliver 200-250 thousand tonnes per year in additional copper production, increasing the Kansanshi’s mine production output. The project has seen substantial progress: assembly of the SAG and ball mills is complete, and installations on the primary crusher are currently underway, with the focus now shifting towards the system’s electrical and piping infrastructure. Commissioning of the 33 kV substation is also on track for Q4 2024, setting the stage for production to begin in the second half of 2025.
Currently $700 million has been spent on the expansion to date, with $500 million more spending expected for completion, which is on track to be on budget. The company has placed a focus on securing its balance sheet while this expansion takes place and the Cobre Panama mine is suspended including mitigating risk through hedging, copper prepayment agreements, and deferring non-essential spend on greenfield projects such as the Taca Taca project in Argentina.
To further strengthen its balance sheet, First Quantum is currently considering partnerships for its Zambian assets, the Kansanshi and Trident (Sentinel & Enterprise) mines, to raise funds to help reduce the company’s debt load and provide additional capital, strengthening the balance sheet. CEO Tristan Pascall confirmed the company’s openness to partnership discussions in the Q3 earnings call, stating that any deal must align with the best interests of all stakeholders. Recent reports suggest that Saudi Arabia's Manara Minerals could acquire a minority stake in First Quantum’s Zambian copper and nickel operations, with a deal valuation estimated at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.

Valuation

Placing a value on a copper miner is hard given the earnings dependence on the copper price. As such, I believe the fairest way is to compare First Quantum Minerals to other copper miners. Given varying levels of debt and cash, a direct comparison of price to earnings will not suffice, and I instead use an enterprise value to EBITDA multiple.
To derive an appropriate EV/EBITDA multiple, I averaged the multiple of other miners which derive a significant proportion of their revenues and profits from copper mining. The companies used were Lundin Mining Corp. (OTCPK:LUNMF), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX), Antofagasta plc (OTC:ANFGF), Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO), and KGHM Polska Miedz S.A. (OTCPK:KGHPF). Taking an average of their EV/EBITDA multiples gives an average multiple of 9.8.
To get to a value for First Quantum, I initially calculated a value excluding the Cobre Panama mine and the company’s shares in joint ventures. First Quantum makes this easier by providing a group EBITDA excluding the Cobre Panama mine and joint ventures in their results. Over the past four quarters, excluding the Cobre Panama Mine and share in joint ventures, the company has generated $1.453 billion in EBITDA.
Applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.8 as discussed above gives an enterprise value of $14.25 billion. With $5.591 billion in net debt, this implies a market cap of $8.67 billion for all non-Cobre Panama assets. With 827.4 million shares outstanding, this is equivalent to $10.47 per share.
With a current market cap of $10.69 billion, and all cash and debt already taken into account previously, this implies a value of $2.02 billion for the Cobre Panama mine operations. The question is whether First Quantum will be able to resume operations there.
With the Cobre Panama mine generating over $1.4 billion in EBITDA in 2023 alone, even with the impact of the mine closure in the fourth quarter, when fully operational its value is significantly above $2.02 billion. The question is whether First Quantum will be able to resume operations there. Should the mine reopen this suggests the potential for significant upside in the share price.
Even if the mine does not become operational again on the same terms, even on worst terms the asset has significantly higher value than the market is currently giving it. Additionally, should the mine not reopen, the potential for compensation from Panama should exceed the $2.02 billion value I predict the market is currently giving this asset.
While the situation is risky and full of uncertainty, the risk-reward balance points towards the upside, especially considering the potential recovery and compensation scenarios for the Cobre Panama mine. Combined with my bullish view of copper prices and expansion at operational mines, I believe the shares are a buy for the adventurous investor.

Risks

The biggest risks impacting an investment in First Quantum Minerals remain the same as in my previous article: the outcome of the Cobre Panama mine and the price of copper.
The bull case for First Quantum relies heavily on the outcome of the Cobre Panama mine. Any changes with regard to operations there will have a significant impact on the share price, but the outcome remains incredibly uncertain. Currently, I believe the market is pricing in some production restarting at some point, or some form of compensation due to the suspension. If mining does recommence, I believe we will see a significant increase in the share price given the size of the mine as part of First Quantum’s portfolio. If this does not occur, the shares could be in for another sharp fall.
With the vast majority of the company’s revenue derived from copper, First Quantum’s revenue and earnings depend heavily on the price of this commodity. Although I have previously made clear my bullishness on the copper price in the long term, and the copper price reaching a record high earlier this year, global economic factors can drive the copper price in the near term. With a near global slowdown in manufacturing occurring, copper prices may potentially fall in the short term. With First Quantum’s financials deeply dependent on the price of copper, falls in the copper price, can negatively impact the earnings and share price of the company.

Conclusion

First Quantum remains an interesting opportunity for investors. With multiple operating mines and ongoing expansion projects contributing to solid third quarter results and a return to profit, the company is in a good shape. On a valuation basis the market appears to be giving the Cobre Panama mine an exceptionally low valuation. While the stock carries risks, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding the Cobre Panama Mine, the valuation reflects a discount, with significant potential upside if operations resume or compensation materializes. I believe the shares remain a buy for the adventurous investor.

Yes, if you believe the news from here on will be good and bad in equal measure, and you are patient enough to wait months or years to see the turn.
However, many have bought over the past four years or so, unconcerned about Boeing’s (NYSE:BA) US Department of Defense (DoD) problems and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and punishments yet to be determined.
Others bought because they only viewed the massive backlog of orders for new commercial aircraft and ignored the above issues.
I did not buy. Since 2000, I have analyzed and written about the real situation at Boeing and the likely follow-on effects for the share price.
Over 36 years of Active, Guard, and Reserve, among many other aircraft from other aerospace contractors, I jumped (parachuted) from the Boeing CH-53E Super Stallion heavy-lift helicopter, and I was transported/deployed many times on the Boeing C-17 Globemaster. I am also familiar with Boeing's MH-47 variation of the Chinook. On another flight, I even had the honor of working the boom on a Boeing KC-135. (Poorly, I might add, but it was my first attempt. Luckily, the F-16 pilot beneath me had plenty of fuel and a good sense of humor…)
Friends of mine have piloted the Boeing F-15 Strike Eagle and the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet. In all cases, we believed these to be exceptional aircraft.
I also have a million plus air miles as a flyer for my business and for pleasure, mostly in older Boeing airplanes that I trusted with my life.
That was then.
In recent years, Boeing has become less of an aircraft design, engineering, and manufacturing company with a premier reputation. Instead, it was run by mostly offsite CEOs and boards more interested in financial engineering than aerospace engineering.
Most people think of Boeing as a commercial aircraft company. It is. But a good chunk of its earnings come from defense and space activities. (Albeit at a declining rate because of the “issues” it has had with delivering a quality product to DoD and NASA.)
Why is this particularly important right now?
Just last month, in a ceremony at Travis Air Force Base (AFB) the United States Air Force sent its last KC-10 to the Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. (These aircraft might be resuscitated in the event of major combat.) That means almost no more tankers of the KC-135 or KC-10 configuration. The United States’ essential refueling capability now depends on the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus next-generation aerial refueling tanker, an airplane that has suffered major problems and huge cost overruns since its inception.

Recent History – The Current Decade

I follow events closely in the aerospace business. My first warning to SA readers was when I expressed my opinion about Boeing’s share price on January 27, 2000. I was not convinced by Boeing’s public response to the deaths that resulted from the two 737MAX MCAS problems was pilot error. I advised readers to SELL. That analysis was titled Why I Won't Be Buying Boeing and is available here. BA’s share price was then $316. It climbed for the next two weeks until US and international airline pilots questioned the “pilot error” response.
There is never just one cockroach in the kitchen.
My next analysis was titled Boeing Vs. Raytheon: Which One Has The Right Stuff? I chose Raytheon (RTX). RTX has since doubled. BA is below its then price. You can see my logic here.
By the time of my next analysis, everyone had learned the real truth about the 737MAX problems. That analysis was titled Darn It, I Still Can't Bring Myself To Buy Boeing. The share price had declined to $222 and many investors jumped in.
My primary concern by then was not just about the 737MAX but about the 777 grounding that resulted from a frightening engine failure on a United flight out of Denver that spit aircraft parts onto a suburb below, as well as the FAA-ordered inspections of more than 200 of the 787s due to torn decompression panels in cargo holds that the FAA said posed a risk to the aircraft if a fire were to break out in the holds.
Also, the newest Boeing passenger jet, the 777X, was postponed because of problems with the GE engines. (At the time I wrote my analysis, Boeing postponed the delivery of the first 777X until late 2023. It still has not been delivered. Recent problems during flight testing grounded the four prototypes. Boeing is now projecting it will begin production in 2026.
My first 2024 Seeking Alpha analysis, in January, also included a SELL rating. Boeing shares were priced at $213. The title of my piece was Boeing: 1, 2, 3 Strikes, You're Out. You can find it here. It gave me no pleasure to again advise a sale of the shares of this once-well-managed company.
I have taken a special interest in the woes of the KC-46. Without air-to-air refueling the US has no forward air combat projection. All those Air Force planes and all those sitting on the decks of Navy carriers are worthless unless they can get to the target and back.
As of today, there are still Category 1 problems that are being fixed as we speak. It costs Boeing revenue every time the Air Force says that the aircraft as delivered does not fulfill the specs as agreed upon at the time of the contract.
For a current review complete with seven links to specific incidents and decisions by regulators, I just two months ago provided an in-depth overview of the current situation. It is titled Boeing: How the Mighty Have Fallen and can be read here.

Moving Forward

Boeing has a well-deserved history of building fine airplanes. They did so for decades – until recently. In the current decade, management at Boeing stressed making the securities analysts happy as much as they did making quality airplanes. There are still current issues with the 737, the 777X, the 787, the KC-46, and the Starliner.
Boeing is talking about shopping their space program to a competitor to save money and focus more precisely on commercial and defense aviation. I am sorry to hear this. Boeing was a key player in building the massive Saturn V rockets. These are the rockets that launched the Apollo program and sent Americans to their moon landing.
Boeing acquired Rockwell International and with it a piece of the space shuttle program. I have had the honor of being at Edwards AFB to see one of the 41 shuttles that returned there from space. The electricity of the waiting crowd cannot be overstated. It was a wonderful, and proud, moment.
Starliner has had its problems but I do not see these as unfixable. Besides, the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket launched the Artemis mission in preparation of the next astronaut moon landing without a problem.
There is good news, sadly missing until just the last few weeks.
It seems Boeing finally might have a hands-on CEO who cares about quality engineering and has the CV to prove it. Kelly Ortberg comes from an engineering background, which is precisely what Boeing has needed and had once upon a time.
He began his career as an engineer at Texas Instruments (TXN) and then joined Rockwell Collins four years later. He rose through the ranks and ultimately became the CEO.
He was in command during the acquisition of Rockwell Collins by the company that became Raytheon (RTX). Ortberg stayed on to lead the merger of Rockwell Collins and shortly thereafter became the CEO of one of the three primary divisions of RTX, Collins Aerospace. He was also the chair of the board of governors of the Aerospace Industries Association. Kelly knows aerospace.
Another good sign. Whereas the previous CEO, David Calhoun, lived on the Gold Coast of Chicago, Mr. Ortberg lived in West Palm Beach – but the moment he accepted the CEO position he decided to move to Seattle where the airplane rubber meets the road/runway.
Kelly Ortberg has his work cut out for him. Boeing has $58 million in debt. He just took the difficult step of raising more cash. The recent offering of shares sold 112.5 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $143.00 per share. This raised about $16 billion. Boeing also sold $5 billion in depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a newly issued Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $50.00 per depositary share. This part of the offering raised almost $5 billion. That gives the company breathing room – but it also dilutes current shareholders’ “piece of the pie” to a rather smaller piece of the pie.
I read some analyses today in which the analysts say that Boeing has declined. Therefore it is priced to buy. I cannot imagine what metrics they are using. The company has no P/E ratio to measure; it has no earnings. The company has an “okay” trailing twelve months EV/Sales ratio and Price/Sales ratio, though both are backward-looking. All other metrics of value are missing!
The commercial airplanes side of the business saw a loss of about $4 billion this last quarter. The defense business lost $2.4 billion, mostly because of charges on the KC-46 program.
There is an immediate ray of hope for at least a short-term bump in the price of BA shares. The striking 33,000 machinists’ union members vote Monday on the latest deal offered by Boeing. I cannot imagine Boeing workers will turn this one down:
The average yearly machinist pay at the end of the four-year contract will be $119,309. They will enjoy a 38% wage increase spread over four years, an incentive pay plan with a guaranteed minimum annual payout of 4%, an increased company 401(K) match, and a one-time “signing bonus” of $12,000 cash!
This agreement carries the strong recommendation of the union bosses. They stated in their communication to striking workers, ""In every negotiation and strike, there is a point where we have extracted everything that we can in bargaining and by withholding our labor. We are at that point now and risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.""
With all that has gone wrong in recent times, am I still suggesting a SELL recommendation on Boeing?
No.
I believe we have finally identified the biggest issues. That is the first step to solving them. The next step is the will of leadership and those who build the airplanes to take decisive action. We are very close to being there.
I think HOLD is a meaningless decision in this case. If you just bought shares on the recent company sale of new shares at $143, this might be a very good HOLD. If you buy it today, it might be a good HOLD. If you bought it at $300 or $250 in a taxable account, and you have other profits that will bump you into a higher bracket, by all means, SELL and buy back 31 days later if you like.
But for me to say HOLD as a blanket recommendation without knowing your entry price, capacity for risk, or anything else about you would be spurious and unprofessional.
Finally, is Boeing worth a BUY recommendation based upon…
* a leader willing to transplant his family and do what it takes to instill a new (old!) culture at Boeing,
* a hard look at the current board, where a clean sweep may be the smartest action,
* the likelihood of a return to work by 33,000 now motivated employees,
* a changed work environment that stresses safety on the manufacturing floor, pride in one’s work, and superior engineering,
*and a promise to the airlines and the DoD of a return to the leadership and manufacturing excellence of previous times?
YES. I expect we will see a good news bump from a (costly) strike settlement that will probably then settle back down.
I am now prepared to BUY shares in Boeing. After maintaining a SELL on Boeing for 4 years, in which the shares fell more than 50%, I believe BA finally has new leadership, a newly motivated workforce, and a clear understanding of what must be done.
I look forward to the day when I can say Boeing's myriad troubles are behind them. It can’t happen too soon for this once-great American company.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732371-fair-isaac-dominant-market-player-with-limited-upside-potential,4732371,Fair Isaac: Dominant Market Player With Limited Upside Potential,"Summary

 -  Fair Isaac Corporation leverages a first-mover advantage, forming key partnerships with major credit agencies and government-sponsored enterprises.
 -  FICO’s dominant US market position and high switching costs bolster its competitive edge and hinder new entrants.
 -  Despite robust cash flow, current valuation suggests limited upside, given the stock price has more than doubled over the past year.


In this analysis, we cover Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO), a data analytics company that provides leading credit scoring services and has a stable 10-year CAGR of 8.12%. In the first section, we analyze the company’s first-mover advantage by examining its historical partnerships with major credit reporting agencies and with mortgage market giants such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, also known as the Government Sponsored Enterprises (Gees). Next, we assess the company’s competitive positioning within the US market and the corresponding benefits it gains. Lastly, we review the company’s financial capabilities in terms of its business model and established market presence.

First Mover Advantage

Firstly, we assess whether the company holds a first-mover advantage in the credit scoring industry by reviewing its historical timeline from its establishment, along with its initial development of key relationships with credit reporting agencies and US mortgage giants.
Fair Isaac was established in 1956 and quickly began developing its first credit scoring system for American investments by 1958 catering to individual clients. By 1981, the company had launched its first credit score used by credit bureaus and introduced the first FICO Score to the US consumer credit markets in 1989. Where CapitalOne (COF) also claimed that FICO is ""the first U.S. credit score... introduced in 1989"", highlighting its pioneering role in the market.
We compile the company's value chain to illustrate its relationship with its partners. The company's early penetration into the financial industry is evidenced by the adoption of its scoring system by all three major credit reporting agencies Experian (OTCQX:EXPGF), Equifax (EFX), and TransUnion (TRU) in 1991. By 1995, the two mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, also adopted the model to evaluate consumer credit risk. This early adoption and widespread endorsement have solidified the company’s position as a first mover in the credit scoring market. In contrast, VantageScore, which was established in 2006 by the three major credit bureaus, has not had the same duration of market exposure or level of endorsement. The difference in their respective total market exposure duration and the endorsement of FICO Scores by major credit reporting bureaus and mortgage giants since the 1990s has positioned FICO Scores differently from newer entrants like VantageScore as it highlights the company’s first mover position.
In 2023, the company’s FICO Scores segment accounted for 51.1% of total revenue, which is further broken down into Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumer operations. On the B2B front, the company collaborates with Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These agencies integrate the company's credit scoring model into their consumer credit reports, which are then utilized by banks to determine loan eligibility for borrowers. Additionally, banks may securitize these mortgages, selling them to US mortgage market players like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Notably, the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2022 had “approved two new credit score models, FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0”, for use by these enterprises.
On the B2C side, the company offers subscriptions for personal credit score assessments directly on its official website. Additionally, the company's software segment provides clients with decision management tools, which support functions such as account origination, customer management, engagement, fraud detection, and marketing.

Based on the above, in the competitive landscape of credit risk assessment, Fair Isaac is also observed to have maintained a dominant presence evidenced by its usage by 9 out of the top 10 US banks by assets. This widespread adoption aligns with the investor presentation showing that ""90% of top US lenders and credit unions"" utilize FICO Scores. This strong position of Fair Isaac is attributable to its extensive history and early entry into the market, which has provided the company with a distinct first-mover advantage. According to Randall Craig, ""The more integration, the higher the switching costs” with SaaS offerings, thus this suggests that FICO’s long-standing relationships and integration of its credit scoring model within the financial systems may have created high potential switching costs that deter banks from adopting competing models, leaving its rival VantageScore more challenging to increase its market presence.
Furthermore, we also compiled the Google Trends based on the terms “FICO Score”, “VantageScore”, “Experian Score”, “TransUnion Score”, and “Equifax Score”. We observed that over the timeframe of a year, FICO Scores have shown to have the highest interest (85/100), followed by Experian, TransUnion and Equifax (in a tie), and VantageScore, where “a value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term”, with 0 being the opposite. We believe the popularity of the Experian Score, TransUnion Score, and Equifax Score is higher than VantageScore because they are well-known credit reporting agencies. Additionally, when consumers search for these agencies, they might be related to FICO scores, as it is the “most commonly known and used credit bureau scores”, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
All in all, we believe with the company established in 1956 and pioneering the first US credit score in 1989, Fair Isaac has demonstrated its first mover advantage through strategic partnerships with all three major consumer reporting agencies by 1991 and being adopted by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by 1995. This early market penetration, compared to VantageScore's establishment in 2006, highlighted a significant difference in the total duration of market exposure. Furthermore, we believe the widespread adoption of FICO Scores by 9 out of the top 10 US banks not only reflects Fair Isaac's dominant market presence but also suggests high switching costs for financial institutions, as it potentially deters them from adopting competing models like VantageScore. Additionally, Google Trends data over the past year also shows the highest public interest in FICO Scores compared to its competitors, further showcasing its prominence and familiarity among consumers. We believe that Fair Isaac's extensive history, early market entry, and deep integration within the financial sector could continue to provide the company with a competitive edge as a first mover.

Complex Regulatory Environment

Furthermore, we examine the company’s strong presence within the US market and analyze the benefits of the US being its major revenue source, contributing to its market dominance.
We compiled the company’s revenue breakdown by geographic location as well as analyzed the benefits in terms of the global consumer lending market, FICO Scores’ approval by the US-regulated mortgage market and the highly complicated regulatory environment where Fair Isaac falls under.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
According to the table and graph above, the company is observed to have a strong focus in the US, contributing to around 85% of total revenue in 2023. Additionally, the company’s average revenue growth within the region also is the highest and only positive among the rest, with a 4-year growth average of 10.3%, higher than the company's total average growth of 6.9%. This overall highlighted the company’s extreme dependence on the US region where any significant market movement in the region could result in direct revenue impact to the company.
In terms of the market, MaximizeMarketResearch reported North America is the region with the largest market share (46%) in global personal loans by 2023, with LendingTree also reporting Americans’ personal loan debt also seeing an increase in Q1 2024, “an 8.9% jump from the previous year”, the number of Americans holding personal loans increasing by 4.9% YoY, and also around 5% increase in average personal loan debt per borrower throughout the same period. This highlights the robust size and growth of the North American personal loan market, and positions US-focused companies to leverage on this benefit.
Furthermore, the company's presence and historical performance in other regions have been relatively weak. Specifically, the Europe, Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific contribute only 9.3% and 5.6% respectively to total revenue. These regions have also experienced much weaker average historical growth, being -7.2% and 0% respectively. In terms of Europe, we believe this is attributable to a lack of local engagement with credit scoring systems. For instance, the CRIF (global credit reporting agency) reported findings showing that “nearly half (46%) of UK consumers never think about their credit score, the highest of all European countries surveyed, including France (35%), Germany (40%) and Italy (27%)”. Additionally, in parts of Asia such as China, a report also claimed that “China does not have a universal credit scoring and registration system”, which limits the acceptance of a single model like FICO Scores.
Fair Isaac also operates within a highly regulated environment in the US, as detailed in its annual report, the company is subject to stringent regulations including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which governs ""the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information"" in consumer reporting and oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that emphasizes “the use and accuracy of credit and alternative data” of credit reporting agencies. These regulatory requirements necessitate continuous compliance from companies like Fair Isaac, which provides direct credit scoring services to the major credit reporting agencies.
Furthermore, FICO Scores and VantageScore also stand out as the only two models accepted by the US mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the two major government-sponsored enterprises responsible for regulating the national mortgage market. This exclusive acceptance highlights their pivotal role in US mortgage underwriting, in contrast to other credit rating models developed by individual lenders which do not appear in this level of standardization, highlighting the unique position of FICO and VantageScore and the benefit which they could capitalize on given their operational focus in the US market.
We believe that the company's strategic focus in the US market positions it well for future growth, especially given that the US personal loans market is the largest among other regions, contributing to almost half of the global shares (46%). Additionally, with Fannie Mae ($4,325 bln) and Freddie Mac ($3,281 bln) holding a combined total asset of approximately $7.6 tln, their endorsement of FICO Scores could largely enhance the company's competitive edge. We believe that this approval, together with the complex regulatory environment in the US, could result in high barriers to entry for new competitors as emerging players in the credit scoring market must not only develop models that comply with stringent regulatory standards but also gain recognition and approval from government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Hence, we believe this favorable environment and already established standardization will continue to support the company's dominance and operational success in the US market given that the company’s average historical revenue growth within the region is also the highest and the only positive among the rest, with a 4-year growth average of 10.3%, higher than the company total average growth of 6.9%.
Additionally, we believe the company could also benefit from the growing credit scoring market. According to FRED, a growing trend in loan issuance across the past decade is shown from $13.9 bln to $22.6 bln in 2023. We believe this trajectory in global lending volume serves as a key market driver as it could increase the demand for more advanced credit risk assessment tools as “Banks and NBFCs are adopting technology to enable paperless and automated lending processes”. Besides, GMInsights also highlighted that the ""shift towards digital banking and fintech solutions requires advanced credit risk rating systems”, with McKinsey reporting that “around 73 percent of the world’s interactions with banks now take place through digital channels” in 2023. We believe that this demand driven by digitalization with more lending activities migrating to digital platforms will drive the market for advanced credit scoring systems, which are essential for ensuring the financial stability of lenders.

Strong Financial Capabilities

Lastly, we determine the company’s dominant position in the credit scoring market by analyzing its financial capability.
We review the company’s historical cash flow trajectory and key expenses, such as COGS and SG&A, which are its two largest expenses, accounting for 19.6% and 26.5%, respectively.
Another advantage of the company is its strong financial capability. The above chart shows that the company has been highly profitable with positive cash flows every year in the past decade, with its FCF margin averaging an impressive 27.5%. This is due to the company’s high net margin at an average of 18.2% and low capex requirements averaging 1.8% of revenues in the past 10 years. Furthermore, Fair Isaac also displays strong financial performance, with a consistent 10-year average revenue CAGR of 8.12%. In terms of the strong average historical net margin, this is attributable to the company’s consistent decline in expenses, with the SG&A % of revenue declining from 35.3% to 26.5% and COGS % of revenue declining from 27.5% to 19.6% over the past decade. We believe this steady decline of COGS could be attributed to the company’s business model as a software company, as in our previous analysis of Workday (WDAY), we identified that the “production costs are minimal” for software companies given the lack of materials and manufacturing expenses. In terms of the decline in SG&A spending in % of total revenue, we believe this is due to the company’s already established network and partners as previously discussed in the first point, as its leadership in the market diminishes the need for aggressive marketing.
According to Fair Isaac’s official website, the company currently has an extensive portfolio with 19 versions of FICO Scores in use by the 3 major credit bureaus, with the most recent version being FICO 10T. The company also has a substantial investment in dollar amount in SG&A and R&D, totaling $401 mln and $160 mln respectively, this highlights its competitive edge over rivals like VantageScore, which only has a total revenue of $6 million by 2023 based on RocketReach, as it enables Fair Isaac to further strengthen its dominance in the market through a larger pool of resources in order to facilitate continued innovations.
Overall, the company’s robust cashflow generation capability is attributable to the low capex requirement as a result of its software business model as well as a high average net margin at 18.2% given its efficient spending in expenses such as SG&A and COGS. Thus, we believe the company could continue its trajectory of growth and further strengthen its leading market position given the benefits from the minimal capex required and an efficient % of revenue maintained for its major expenses as well as its access to a larger pool of resources to facilitate its innovations.
Hence, we valued the company using a P/FCF valuation by projecting the company’s FCF until 2028. In terms of revenue growth, we based it on the consensus growth for the next 5 years respectively given that the average revenue surprise in % over the past decade only averaged 1%, and the full-year revenue guided by management has also been raised to $ 1.7 bln due to an “increase in FICO platform and FICO 10-T adoption”, placing it fairly in line with consensus. In 2024, we projected an FCF margin of 36.28% by factoring in an increase of 1.37% per year which we derived from the past 9-year FCF average growth. Based on the current share price of $1,745 and the company’s historical 5-year average P/FCF ratio, we derived a price target of $1,661 in 2028, which we then prorated to derive our price target of $1,728 in 2024, at a downside of -0.99%.

Risk: Revenue Concentration In the Banking Industry

According to the annual report, 91% of Fair Isaac’s total revenue was “derived from sales of products and services to the banking industry”. Since FICO charges per credit score generated, an economic downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of credit applications as consumers and businesses become more cautious about incurring debt, thus we believe this could result in fewer credit scores being requested from banks and directly impacting company revenue.

Verdict

All in all, we believe Fair Isaac’s outlook appears robust due to its dominant position in the US credit scoring market, supported by extensive adoption among major US banks and high barriers to entry due to regulatory compliance and GSE approvals. We believe that the company also benefits from a first-mover advantage with its deep market penetration and a high switching cost environment that made it more challenging for new entrants to gain a larger presence. The growing US personal loans market, where FICO mainly operates, and a future trend towards digital banking, further suggest a steady demand for FICO's credit scoring products. Moreover, we believe that FICO's business model emphasizing low capex requirements coupled with its historical efficiencies in managing major expenses such as SG&A and COGS, positions the company to maintain its strong margins and robust free cash flow generation. The company growth is further believed to be supported by continuous innovations given its access to a much larger resource pool compared to major rivals such as VantageScore which only has a single-digit revenue size.
Overall, we valued the company based on our P/FCF valuation as the company demonstrated robust cashflows throughout the past 10 years. We derived a price target of $1,933 in 2024, indicating a downside of 3.72%, thus we rate it as a Hold given the strong rise in the company’s stock price in the past year which has increased by 138%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732365-silj-silver-miners-pullback-is-an-opportunity,4732365,SILJ: Silver Miners' Pullback Is An Opportunity,"Summary

 -  Silver mining companies have outperformed the broad US and Canadian stock markets in 2024.
 -  I have a buy rating on SILJ due to its favorable valuation, strong momentum, and impressive technicals.
 -  While SILJ is highly volatile, I see upside ahead despite enhanced volatility around the US election.


The presidential election is on the doorstep. Among the many so-called “Trump trades” appears to be long precious metals. Many macro pundits contend, however, that no matter who resides in the White House come January 20th next year, high deficit spending and global central bank buying of precious metals support the case for higher gold and silver prices.
Silver, specifically, is up more than 36% so far in 2024, outpacing gold by about four percentage points. Both of the shiny metals are beating the S&P 500 year-to-date. Silver is often seen as a high beta and more cyclically exposed asset versus gold. What’s even more volatile, usually, are shares of silver mining companies.
I have a buy rating on the Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:SILJ). The fund is very volatile, which should imply a lower position size compared to other broader-based funds. But with a low valuation, positive seasonal trends, and impressive technicals, I see upside ahead. Be on guard for enhanced volatility leading up to and immediately after the November 5th election.

Silver, Gold, Silver Miners Beating the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) YTD



According to the issuer, SILJ tracks the performance of companies engaged in the silver mining industry that derive the majority of their revenues from silver mining, global silver production, or exploration and development activities related to new silver production. SILJ seeks investment results that generally correlate (before fees and expenses) to the total return performance of the Nasdaq Junior Silver Miners™ Index.
SILJ is a small ETF with just $1.2 billion in assets under management as of October 31, 2024. There has been a volume uptick in recent months as shares have taken off, but its forward dividend yield is scant, near 0%, while the annual expense ratio is on the high side at 0.69%.
Share-price momentum is very robust today, earning the ETF an A+ ETF Grade by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. In fact, SILJ is now ranked No. 5 out of 412 in its Asset Class. But as mentioned earlier, SILJ is not for the faint of heart – its Risk Rating is as bad as it gets due to nosebleed level standard deviation trends, high turnover, and significant tracking error.
There’s also a high percentage of assets in the top 10 holdings. Liquidity is a strong point – its average daily volume is more than two million shares while the 30-day median bid/ask spread is moderate at seven basis points, per Amplify ETFs.
Silver miners are not the highest quality businesses, but the valuation is compelling, which plays a key role in my buy rating. The 1-star, Neutral-rated ETF by Morningstar features a low 13.4x price-to-earnings ratio, while its long-term EPS growth is high at 18.4%. The resulting PEG ratio is just 0.7.
Prospective investors must recognize that SILJ’s portfolio is primarily Canadian SMID caps, making it highly susceptible to country and industry-specific risks.

SILJ: Portfolio & Factor Profiles



With more than half of the allocation invested in the top 10 stocks, there’s material concentration risk. Keeping up with both the fundamentals and technicals of the top positions, Pan American Silver Corp (PAAS), Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd ADR (HMY), and Coeur Mining, Inc. (CDE), is key. There are also gold miners in the junior silver miners fund.

SILJ: Holdings & Dividend Information



Seasonally, there are bullish trends to consider. While I was cautious on the Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL) in July, due in part to calendar trends, silver the commodity tends to perform well into year-end and through May of the new year.
For SILJ, November returns are neutral, but December to January performance has been decent over the past 10 years.

SILJ: Solid Seasonal Trends Through January




Silver: A Strong Seasonal Stretch Ongoing




The Technical Take

With a low valuation and solid seasonal trends for silver, SILJ’s technical chart is positive. Notice in the graph below that shares put in a solid base from mid-2022 through the first quarter of 2024. Following an upside reversal, the long-term 200-day moving average turned positive back in April. A golden cross pattern in which the short-term 50dma rose above the 200dma transpired shortly after.
Resistance came about just above the $13 mark before another breakout just recently. But the fund has retreated from its multi-year high as Election Day approaches. Key support is between $13 and $13.50 while $15 is resistance (the high from April 2022. Further down, more significant support is apparent close to $10.50. A rally through the year-to-date high could result in an advance to the 2021 peak of $18.
Overall, the trend is higher despite the downtick in momentum in the past week.

SILJ: Bullish Breakout After a Big Base, Rising 200dma




The Bottom Line

I have a buy rating on SILJ. The fund’s valuation is very low, even after a strong rally since the first quarter. Support is not far below the current price after a long-term bullish breakout earlier this year.

 -  SPMC predominantly invests in CLO equity tranches, with about 95% of its portfolio consisting of these high-yield but high-risk instruments. The remaining investments include warehouse debt and CLO debt.
 -  SPMC has not utilized leverage as of its Q2 2024 financials but has secured a revolving credit facility of $100 million, extendable up to $125 million, at competitive interest rates.
 -  SPMC announced a public offering of 8.00% Series A Preferred Shares, resulting in $48.2 million in proceeds. These shares are rated ‘BBB’ by Egan-Jones and are expected to trade.
 -  The issuance of these preferred shares introduces leverage, which requires consistent interest payments (unlike optional drawdowns on a revolving facility).
 -  While leverage can enhance returns in a stable or improving market, it increases vulnerability during market dislocations. Historical data shows CLO equity CEFs can experience sharp declines, with drawdowns of up to -40% during crises like 2020 and 2022.


Thesis

Sound Point Meridian Capital Inc (SPMC) is a CLO closed end fund ('CEF'). The vehicle is new, coming to market in 2024. The CEF focuses on CLO equity, thus representing a more risky proposal than other names, and finding itself at the opposite side of the spectrum from AAA CLO ETFs such as the PGIM AAA CLO ETF (PAAA) which we recently covered.
The Seeking Alpha platform coverage for SPMC was started by ADS Analytics with a good article in September. In today's piece we are going to provide a structural update for SPMC, and highlight why we believe today's macro environment is the wrong one to leverage up, all while finding SPMC's recent preferred shares issuance more appealing than the common shares.

Robust CLO Equity fund

Firstly let us have a cursory look at what SPMC actually does. The CEF invests its cash in CLO equity tranches:


CLO equity represents roughly 95% of the fund, followed by warehouse debt and CLO debt. CLO equity is the riskiest portion of the structure, and while it can provide for high returns during economic recoveries or expansions, it is quick to record significant drawdowns during recessions.
On underlying metrics and analytics, SPMC is well-diversified with a robust portfolio:


The fund does a 'look-through' in reporting its metrics, by taking each underlying CLO and its collateral. The fund has 1,532 underlying individual loans with a weighted average portfolio spread of 3.53% versus a market median of 3.5%. The WA Moody's Rating Factor shows a single-B rated portfolio for the underlying loans. The vast majority of individual loans here are first lien senior secured, which is a positive:


The benefit of leverage loans lies in their ability to have company assets as collateral with a first priority lien.

Leverage magnifies returns - both on the upside and on the downside

Please note that as of the latest CEF financials, the company has not employed any leverage:


The Q3 2024 financials are not yet available, so the above is a snapshot from the Q2 2024 balance sheet. In July 2024, the CEF entered into a revolving bank facility:
Kindly keep in mind that a revolving credit facility is like a line of credit. The CEF does not necessarily have to utilize it, and simply pays 'unused' fees on the facility. These fees relate to the balance sheet and contingent capital banks have to set aside in order to provide this service. The point is though that the facility does not have to be used, and the CEF incurs minimal costs if it doesn't.
When looking at the current yield for the CEF, we noticed that it is equivalent to an unleveraged one:


CLO equity outright tends to provide yields in the 12% to 14% range, thus SPMC does not seem to use any leverage currently. Please note that leveraged CLO equity CEFs such as Oxford Lane Capital Corporation (OXLC) provide for yields in the 20% area.

New preferred shares

While the CEF does not seem to use its revolver (we will see exactly when they release their Q3 2024 financials), it has just issued term preferred equity:
The CEF is getting $48.2 million in cash, which it will need to deploy in order to cover the interest expenses on the preferred shares. Unlike the revolver, the CEF actually has to pay out the 8% annual rate here. While we think the rate is attractive for the fund long term, the timing in terms of leveraging up is not ideal in our opinion. An investor can find the prospectus here.
SPMA is a good addition to the CEF notes universe when considering an investment in the space, and it will be interesting to see how it prices when it breaks for trading. In the past, we have seen some nice arbitrage opportunities here.

Why is leverage not ideal in today's macrocycle

We are in a point in time where credit spreads are very low across the fixed income spectrum. When credit spreads are very low, the only way for them to go is up. While we acknowledge spreads can remain low for a long time if a soft landing does indeed materialize, it is not prudent to add leverage when spreads are this low. By definition, funds should be aggressive when spreads dislocate higher, and prudent when they are towards the bottom of their historic range:


The above table presents the ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread. We are using single-B here because this CEF has a single-B weighted average rating for its underlying loans. The current spread level is at 275 bps, literally the lowest in the past decade. While we are not calling for a recession, it is absolutely not prudent to leverage up here.
While we understand why the CEF is doing what it is doing (attractive cost of liabilities and necessity to compete with peers on yield) taking a step back and looking at the macro picture presents a different story. The fund is new, and in our view it has a bit of time to prove itself. Thus it could wait out a dislocation in spreads. However, the CEF felt the need to bump up its distribution yield to align better with its peers. While we respect that move in light of the competitive cohort, we are much rather inclined to look at the investment grade rated preferred shares here. Kindly keep in mind how drawdowns look like for CLO equity CEFs:


We have used the total return graph in order to capture the asset class particularities, and we can see -40% drawdowns are to be expected for this cohort of CEFs. It happened in 2020 and in 2022 on the back of market dislocations. Leverage amplifies the upside but also the downside. Leveraging up when spreads are at historic low levels is not prudent, and opens the door for large drawdowns on the common shares in case of a recession.

Conclusion

SPMC is a CLO equity CEF. The fund is new, having IPO-ed in 2024. The name is moving towards introducing leverage in the capital structure via a new issuance of preferred shares, which are set to start trading under the ticker SPMA. While the preferred shares are priced attractively and rated investment grade, they introduce leverage in the CEF capital structure at a time when credit spreads are at historic lows. We would have preferred to see SPMC remain unleveraged longer and take advantage of credit market dislocations to leverage up via its revolver. We are more keen on the preferred shares versus the common for this name from a risk/reward perspective.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732361-kongsberg-gruppen-valued-too-high-stock-not-sell-yet,4732361,"Kongsberg Gruppen: Valued Too High, But Not A Stock To Sell Yet","Summary

 -  Kongsberg Gruppen stock has appreciated further since my last report, marking the stock a hold.
 -  Results show strong growth in all segments, underpinned by high demand.
 -  From a valuation perspective, the stock is quite expensive at current levels.
 -  I am Dhierin Bechai. Using my Aerospace Engineering expertise, I provide a data-driven approach to investing ideas in the growing aerospace, defense and airline industry. I run the investing group The Aerospace Forum.


I initiated coverage for Kongsberg Gruppen (OTCPK:NSKFF) in May this year and back then I still saw an opportunity to buy the stock with potential market outperforming results and that did happen as the stock has delivered a 37.3% return compared to a 9.2% return for the S&P 500. In July, I marked Kongsberg Gruppen stock a hold as from a fundamental point of view, there was little upside. The stock continued to outperform, but the outperformance was less impressive, with a 5.2% return compared to a 3.7% return for the market.
In this report, I will be discussing the most recent earnings and review my rating and price target for the stock.

Kongsberg Gruppen Sales And Earnings Maintain Momentum



Kongsberg Gruppen reports its revenues in NOK. To get a feel of the numbers, NOK1 is $0.091, which means that if you divide the amounts in NOK by 11 you have a rough approximation of the dollar value of the results. Third quarter revenues grew by 19% to NOK11.92 billion during the quarter. The revenue growth was carried by all segments, but we see the strongest relative growth in Maritime, Defense & Aerospace and Discovery.
Kongsberg Maritime saw sales growth of 20%. Like in previous quarters, the growth was broadly supported with higher new vessel deliveries driven by LNG tankers and commercial merchant vessels as well and aftermarket sales growth. The defense and aerospace segment saw revenue grow by 8%. The growth in sales tapered somewhat driven by a transition to a new missile production facility and a higher comparable basis.
The Discovery segment saw 21% year-on-year growth, driven by delivery of mapping and positioning systems. Kongsberg Digital revenues grew by 17% with 18% growth in recurring revenues. The growth was driven by a higher user base for the Kognitwins and higher sales for ship-to-cloud solutions.
What I have observed for several quarters is that the revenue growth drivers are more or less the same, which shows there are no huge surprises but also makes it necessary that Kongsberg Gruppen continues to pave the way for additional sales to keep the growth rates robust.


Kongsberg Gruppen grew sales by 19% and realized EBIT grew 47%. It is yet another indicator that higher demand is translating to sales and to higher profits and margins, as fixed costs are being amortized more favorably now. Maritime EBIT grew from 620 million NOK to 1.11 billion NOK, with a strong margin expansion from 12.3% to 17.1%. The performance was driven by volume, favorable mix and lower risks on several programs. EBIT for Defence & Aerospace grew from 590 million NOK to 690 million NOK, driven by mix and volume, with margins expanding from 15.1% to 16.2%.
The Discovery segment, once again, saw a modest margin contraction due to sales mix with EBIT growing from 150 million NOK to 170 million NOK on higher volumes. The Digital business is still loss making, driven by continued investments required for the business. However, we do see that the loss margins are narrowing. The Digital segment has massive potential, but unless sufficient scale is achieved, it is not a moneymaker.
Important to note is that all money-making segments of Kongsberg Gruppen saw a book-to-bill ratio higher than one bringing the book-to-bill ratio for the entire company to 1.1 and 1.23 year-to-date which, I believe, is an indication that revenue growth is supported by demand.

Kongsberg Gruppen Stock Lacks Upside, But I Await 2027 Estimates



To determine multi-year price targets, The Aerospace Forum has developed a stock screener which uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows and the most recent balance sheet data. Each quarter, we revisit those assumptions, and the stock price targets accordingly. In a separate blog, I have detailed our analysis methodology.
There are definitely a lot of things that I do like about Kongsberg Gruppen. EBITDA is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.3% while FCF will grow an 11% rate and the company is in a net cash position. That is not something you find often, a company with a double-digit growth rate and without a significant debt load. However, that is not enough to mark the stock a buy. The company is valued richly in line with peers, but significantly above its median valuation. While I think a peer group valuation is justified, valuing the stock in line with FY26 is a bit too much for my taste. I wouldn’t say that I don’t like Kongsberg Gruppen or that the stock will not appreciate further, but I believe the reality is that the stock is now trading far ahead without any significant upside. I am not putting a sell rating at this point as I await estimates for 2027 which could provide upside, but the stock is definitely inching closer to a sell rating due to its rich valuation.

Conclusion: Kongsberg Gruppen Lacks Fundamental Upside

Kongsberg Gruppen definitely has a lot of growth ahead, and the earnings already show that growing demand is turning into sales and higher earnings. However, if we look at the valuation of the company, we can only conclude that the stock is trading far ahead of its earnings and that does not provide for a compelling investment case. The stock is currently still a hold in my view, but expectations for 2027 are going to be pivotal to the company avoiding a sell rating.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732360-celestica-stock-is-a-real-ai-bargain-today,4732360,Celestica Stock Is A Real AI Bargain Today,"Summary

 -  Celestica's Q3 2024 report shows ~$2.5 billion in revenues - that was a 22% growth year over year, with the CCS segment experiencing a stunning 42% YoY expansion.
 -  We see Celestica continuing to raise internal expectations - the market is listening and following suit by also significantly raising revenue/EPS estimates en masse.
 -  Celestica still seems too undervalued to ignore. According to my calculations, the fair value of Celestica's stock today is around $101 - that's almost 48% more than the stock's price.
 -  Therefore, I've decided to update my ""Buy"" rating today.
 -  I am Oakoff Investments, a quantitative research analyst. I run the investing group Beyond the Wall Investing where I specialize in uncovering mispriced stocks based on proprietary Wall Street information.


My Updated Thesis

I initiated coverage of Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) stock in mid-March 2024 with a ""Buy"" rating, calling it ""the ultimate AI pick at a reasonable price, unlike many other stocks in this space."" In mid-July 2024 I decided to reiterate my ""Buy"" rating again calling as CLS's Q1 2024 results at the time exceeded expectations thanks to the strong performance in their CCS segment. I argued that the probability of Celestica beating analysts' forecasts for Q2 2024 was very high, while the stock itself seemed quite undervalued. As it turned out at the end of October 2024, when Celestica reported the actual figures for the second quarter and once again far exceeded expectations, my optimism wasn't in vain.


As a result, my call aged well:


Despite this success, I am of the opinion that Celestica hasn't yet fully exploited its true growth potential - in the medium term, the stock will probably remain under strong buying pressure due to its undervaluation and the company's further growth prospects.

My Reasoning

Celestica's Q3 2024 report shows ~$2.5 billion in revenues - that was a 22% growth year over year, with the Connectivity and Cloud Solutions (CCS) segment experiencing a stunning 42% YoY expansion. That was driven by ""intense demand from hyperscalers for data center infrastructure and networking switches in the HPS segment"", the press release noted. The operating margin of the CCS business rose by 140 basis points to 7.6% driven by ""an increase in volumes and a healthier product mix."" On the other hand, ATS (Advanced Technology Solutions) saw a 5% decrease in the top line as the industrial segment continued to show weakness. Yet that was partly offset by gains in the Aerospace and Defense ((A&D)) and capital equipment sub-segments, which grew 15% and 31% YoY, respectively. The margin in ATS narrowed down to 4.8% as the industrial end market had lower operating leverage, but despite all these challenges, Celestica's overall non-IFRS operating margin improved by 100 basis points to 6.7%, illustrating how the company can exploit its strengths in strategic verticals.


Celestica's adjusted EPS for Q3 2024 of $1.04 was well above the company's guidance level and was actually the highest quarterly EPS in the firm's history. Production efficiencies and operating leverage within the CCS business led to an increase in the adjusted gross margin of the company by 90 basis points to 10.7%. Further, Celestica's adjusted ROIC increased to 28.6% due to higher operating margins and improved working capital controls.
As we know, Celestica has divested over $1 billion in non-strategic business in the past 5 years, including ending a long-term manufacturing partnership with Cisco (CSCO). This has enabled Celestica to benefit from strong demand for customer investments in AI and machine learning, along with accelerating demand for networking solutions from hyperscaler customers. As a result, we saw the wind out of the stock's sails, as it rose by 192% in the past year, putting it well ahead of most of its peers:


I think end markets' conditions still favor Celestica's strategic plans, especially in the AI and data center market. The firm seems to be well-positioned to take advantage of the current tide of AI infrastructure investments made by hyperscalers and digital native companies. Celestica's background in creating and assembling advanced hardware, coupled with a full-service offering, allows it to service a wide range of customers in this rapidly growing market, which is a great competitive advantage, in my view.
Looking beyond 2024, Celestica management anticipates continued growth, fuelled by new AI/ML compute wins and scaling up programs on hyperscalers. The company expects revenue growth of 8% in 2025, a non-IFRS operating margin improvement, and adjusted EPS growth of 15% YoY. I think Celestica's strong focus on growth-oriented, high-growth companies and rigorous financial approach should allow it to take advantage of new opportunities and keep bringing enduring value to shareholders, as it did in the recent past.


A few words on the shorter term: The management estimates the revenue to come between $2.425-2.575 billion in Q4, a 17% mid-year increase. The adjusted Q4 EPS is expected to be $0.99-1.09 and the non-IFRS operating margin is expected to be 6.7%. For 2024 as a whole, Celestica expects $9.6 billion in revenues and $3.85 in adjusted EPS, up 21% and 58%, respectively.


So based on this updated outlook, we see Celestica continuing to raise internal expectations - the market is listening and following suit by also significantly raising revenue/EPS estimates en masse:


At the same time, Celestica's balance sheet still looks healthy, with a cash balance of $399 million and total liquidity of ~$1.1 billion (including a revolver's $750 million borrowing facility). The firm's gross debt as of the close of Q3 2024 was $746 million, with a net debt balance of only $347 million. Celestica's trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA vs gross debt ratio was 1.0 turns, also indicating a healthy balance sheet condition.
All that makes me remain positive about Celestica's growth prospects - the company's positive earnings growth and prospects in the CCS space should keep the rally going, in theory. The still existing undervaluation, which I'd like to discuss below, also favors the rally's continuation, in my opinion.
If you look at CLS, you'll see that it's trading at just less than 18 times the next year's EPS estimate, slightly above the 10-year historical average multiple. Some might argue that it indicates that CLS is now fairly valued, but I suggest looking at the firm's gross margin, which keeps climbing - it's now way over the norms of 2015 or 2021 when CLS was trading significantly more richly valued than today.


So given Celestica's impressive growth rates, which are above the industry average, and the fact that the company is still lagging on some margin metrics (which I think will keep rising), it's reasonable to project a fair P/E ratio for the stock in the 20-22x range over the medium term. Historically, the company has consistently outperformed EPS consensus estimates, with an average upside surprise of around 8-12%, according to Seeking Alpha Premium. So if Celestica continues this trend and beats the current consensus by 8% for 2025, the stock should be fairly valued at $101 per share at a P/E of 21x by the end of 2025. This forecast suggests a potential upside of almost 48% from today's price, which represents a promising investment opportunity despite the astonishing rally over the past year.
Celestica looks like a real bargain at its current price in its AI niche. So, based on all the above discussion, I think I have to leave my ""Buy"" rating unchanged this time around.

Risks To My Thesis

Despite its advantages, there are challenges for Celestica such as customer concentration risk and industry rivalry from the bigger guys. In Q3 2024, 2 customers made over 10% of the total sales, making 25% and 12% of sales, respectively. Although the company believes that it can still attain the right mix of multiprogram diversification for its biggest customers, I think the customer concentration it has today is a huge risk to be aware of, at least.
In addition, Celestica's bold expansion plans in Thailand and Malaysia pose risks such as delays and higher costs due to logistical challenges and material shortages in the market. These projects are expected to boost sales and earnings growth in the foreseeable future, but from the perspective of the geographic location of CLS' presence, this makes Celestica a riskier investment. The resulting valuation discount could last longer than I'm expecting.
Any reader of my article today should also keep in mind that my valuation calculations based on P/E multiple expectations may be wrong, as they appear to be subjective. So CLS may not have the upside potential that I would derive from a very different valuation metric.

Your Takeaway

Overall, Celestica continued to surprise me - the Q3 2024 report exceeded the numbers even more than I had expected in my previous article. Clearly, the AI hype is real - at least for Celestica, as the customer base continues to grow and the move to strengthen the Connectivity and Cloud Solutions segment was clearly the right strategic move. Now management is reaping the rewards and investors are enjoying a logical rally in the stock price. And I think this rally is far from over, as CLS still seems too undervalued to ignore. According to my calculations, the fair value of Celestica's stock today is around $101 - that's almost 48% more than the stock's price. Therefore, I've decided to update my ""Buy"" rating today.
Good luck with your investments!

 -  Brazil faces rising inflation and a record fiscal deficit, causing iShares MSCI Brazil ETF to drop 19% in 2024 while the S&P 500 gained 20%.
 -  The Brazilian real has deeply weakened against the U.S. dollar, driven by fiscal concerns and rising interest rates.
 -  EWZ’s P/E ratio has risen to 8.5x, which remains the lowest among most emerging countries.
 -  I believe investors should wait for currency stabilization and fiscal improvements before purchasing EWZ.


In my previous article on the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (NYSEARCA:EWZ), written in December last year, I made it clear that in the long term, the scenario for the Brazilian economy involved cycles of growth followed by slowdowns and persistent risks. The cycle to 2024 looked favorable, with Brazilian equities at a low valuation and with little debt despite signs of “a flash in the pan.”
At the time, a scenario where there was an anticipation of Brazil's interest rate (Selic) dropping below double digits in 2024/2025, an improved GDP outlook, controlled and decreasing inflation, and a stable exchange rate in the face of a declining U.S. yield curve seemed like an opportunity.
As it turned out, the outlook proved to be quite wrong in the face of a series of tensions that have unfolded. The main ones include exchange rate pressure, a reversal of the fall in interest rates at a time when there has been an increase in long-term rates, and a climate of fiscal uncertainty, all of which have had a negative impact on financial assets. Over the ten months to 2024, the EWZ has fallen 18% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has jumped 23%.


Over the course of this year, Brazil's 12-month accumulated inflation rose from 3.8% in May to 4.2% in August. As a result, the country's Central Bank interrupted a sequence of interest rate cuts, which went from 13.75% in August 2023 to 10.5% by September 2024, when it saw an increase of another 0.25 points. It's worth remembering that expectations at the start of 2024 pointed to figures below two digits.


This turnaround in itself was one of the major factors that caused the equities in the EWZ to be hit hard. However, over the course of this article, I'll go into the details of what's been pushing EWZ, where it's heading, and whether now is still a good opportunity to go long on this ETF.

Overview of EWZ and Its Holdings

The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) is a simple way for global investors to access Brazilian equities, as it aims to follow the performance of stocks in the MSCI Brazil Index. However, EWZ doesn’t fully align with the Brazilian stock market, known as the Ibovespa. In addition to tracking Brazilian market performance, EWZ is also impacted by shifts in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real.
Looking at EWZ’s key holdings, the state-controlled oil company Petrobras (PBR) (PBR.A) currently makes up about 14% of the fund. Next, Nu Holdings (NU), the largest digital bank in the world, accounts for 11.2%, and the iron ore giant Vale (VALE) accounts for 9.7%. In fourth place, another bank stands out, Itaú Unibanco (ITUB), which accounts for 7.8% of EWZ's weight.


Together, these four companies account for 43% of EWZ's holdings. As we can see from the graph below, although the main holding has appreciated by almost 90% over the year, the other three have accumulated strong falls, especially with commodity companies like Vale and Petrobras helping to pull the index down, as they have been affected by lower iron ore and gasoline prices.


When we compare the performance of the EWZ versus the Ibovespa (chart below), we can see that it diverges considerably. The reason behind this divergence has a direct correlation with the main factor weighing down the EWZ versus the Ibovespa, which is the exchange rate, a topic I'll go into in detail next.



Exchange Rate Tensions and Rising Interest Rates Exerting Strong Pressure

One of, if not the main, point that has had a negative influence on the performance of the EWZ has a direct correlation with the trajectory of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real. Recently, one USD today, at the beginning of November, stands at BRL 5.70, the highest level in at least the last decade. This level was only reached thanks to not only a global appreciation of the American currency but also a deterioration in confidence regarding Brazil's domestic conditions.


Arguably, one of the main factors weighing on the devaluation of the BRL is fiscal policy, an issue that has been very controversial since the left-wing Workers Party government of President Lula da Silva took office. This is because the fiscal deficit hit a record of R$1.11 trillion in August, surpassing the worst moment in January 2021 during the pandemic when it had reached R$1.016 trillion when it had shrunk to R$460 million by the end of 2022 (when it marked the end of the Bolsonaro government).
On the one hand, we have the misaligned fiscal issue and, on the other, the Central Bank itself, which, in my opinion, has discouraged expectations and disorganized the market. At the last meeting, the Brazilian Central Bank increased the interest rate (Selic) and indicated the possibility of further increases in the coming months, which I consider unnecessary, especially at a time when the rest of the world is in a cycle of interest rate cuts.
When we look at the behavior of futures rates, we see long rates for 2033 reaching 12.77%. This is a symptom of the current state of the Brazilian economy. The rise in interest rates is much more a local issue than an external one, despite the rise in US interest rates, especially since September.


Furthermore, when comparing Brazilian long rates with those of our Latin American peers, we see that Colombia is just above 10% on the 10-year rate, while Brazil is close to 13%. Peru is around 6.3%, and Chile is at 5.5%, both with no signs of interest rate increases, which is the opposite of Brazil. This scenario impacts the Brazilian stock market and, consequently, the EWZ, as foreign investors are leaving the market.
As the EWZ falls by almost 20% over the year against the S&P 500, for example, the small-cap index in Brazil (SMAL11), on which the iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF (EWZS) is based, is down more than 11% for the year, and even the real estate fund index, called the IFIX in Brazil, is down 3.3% for the year, with a large part of this drop occurring in the last two months. Much of this fall is explained by macroeconomic issues: long-term interest rates are rising, and when real long-term rates rise, this has a negative impact on real estate assets, which depend on cash flow.



What Must Happen for EWZ to Unlock Its Value

I believe that the economic scenario in Brazil has revolved around the fiscal issue, where despite record revenue through taxation, the market has not been convinced by the record deficit.
The Moody's rating agency, which recently upgraded Brazil's rating, pointed out that confidence in Brazil's fiscal framework is moderate - they were even quite generous, as many consider this credibility to be well below moderate. In any case, if the government doesn't take concrete action to address the record deficit, it won't convince the market.
Recently, there was a meeting with several Brazilian banks to discuss the interest rate in Brazil, seeking some understanding or solution to the current situation. This is the main concern of President Lula's government. Of course, it's important to discuss interest rates, but interest rates are yet another symptom, the consequence of a bloated state that spends too much, has a colossal deficit and never stops issuing debt. So, the debt/GDP ratio keeps rising. That's what needs to be dealt with, not the symptom, the interest rate.


This also sounds the alarm for another important point, which is GDP growth. Brazil's GDP has been surprisingly positive in recent years, even prompting some American banks to revise their forecasts recently.
J.P. Morgan, for example, estimated Brazilian GDP growth at 2.9% at the start of the year but now projects growth of 3.2%. On the other hand, it is worth noting that when there is a lot of government spending financed by debt, it may temporarily increase GDP.
Also, considering that Brazil is a major exporter of commodities, the volatility of raw material prices has also had an impact on the demand for the Brazilian real.
Thus, I see a lot of complexity ahead for the EWZ to unlock value, where it will depend a lot on a stable currency, even with the main equities being at very de-risked valuations.

Final Remarks

From the end of 2023 until now, there was a good evolution in the P/E of the EWZ, which traded at 5.4x and now trades at 8.46x, even with the strong devaluation throughout this year. One explanation for this can be explained by lower profits in cyclical sectors exposed to commodities, such as Energy, Materials, and Industrials, which together account for 40% of the EWZ.
This is coupled with slower demand globally. This contributes to the fall in profits, raising the P/E without necessarily meaning growth in share prices. Also, the devaluation of the real against the dollar reduces the value of the dollar earnings of companies listed in Brazil, especially those with exposure to the domestic market.
The other thing to consider is that this has also been seen among the other ETFs of the emerging countries that make up the BRICS, with the exception of India. However, the China and India ETFs have performed quite well over the course of the year, as can be seen in the chart below.


One peer that, I think, is worth comparing with Brazil is Mexico, which, despite not being part of the BRICS, is still trading at a P/E fairly in line with that at the end of last year, even though its performance is even worse than the EWZ.
Despite EWZ's underperformance, its valuation is becoming less and less attractive, and this is certainly not a positive point. However, it's always worth pointing out that investing in emerging markets often requires a more cyclical approach. And at the moment, the cycle seems to be rather clouded by uncertainties in the fiscal scenario caused by political risk.
That's why I believe that, for the time being, investors should view the EWZ with caution until there are more concrete signs of stabilization in the exchange rate, which could be the main avenue for a turnaround in the EWZ's performance.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732356-ellington-financial-10-09-preferred-share,4732356,10.09% Preferred Share From Ellington Financial,"Summary

 -  EFC-A recently changed to a floating rate.
 -  Despite the 10% yield, investors should be aware of the risks.
 -  Since they haven’t called EFC-E, there’s a decent chance that they won’t call them.
 -  I am Colorado Wealth Management Fund. I lead the investing group The REIT Forum where I use my decades of industry experience to share investment ideas in Equity REITs, Mortgage REITs, and preferred shares.


I will be going over a preferred share from Ellington Financial (NYSE:EFC). While we will be covering the Q3 2024 earnings release (when it happens), we did not post a Q2 2024 article for the public. Therefore, I’m going to briefly share Scott Kennedy’s analysis of the common stock and then move on to the preferred share.

Ellington Financial common stock by Scott Kennedy

As expected, Q2 2024 was a good quarter for EFC on both BV and core earnings/EAD. Still, I want to see continued progress regarding EFC’s core earnings/EAD in future quarters. Remember, I hold EFC to a “higher standard” versus most hybrid mREIT sub-sector peers. EFC’s core earnings/EAD is still modestly below the company’s current quarterly run-rate dividend of $0.39 per common share (monthly dividends at a current rate of $0.13 per common share). EFC has made some good progress growing core earnings/EAD over the prior 2 quarters but this was something I already correctly modeled. Regarding a risk/performance rating upgrade in relation to EFC’s core earning/EAD, it would take, at the least, a modestly outperforming quarter versus my models.
It is still going to be a hard feat to increase core earnings/EAD back to (or above) $0.39 per common share during 2024. As such, I cannot rule out another minor dividend decrease during 2024 - early 2025. I am not stating this is a certainty but merely a possibility. As such, my previously projected EFC monthly dividend range of $0.12 - $0.13 per common share through December 2024 remains unchanged.
That said, I continue to approve of EFC diversifying the company’s portfolio of investment products and looking for ways to synergize its operations. This included the full buyout of Longbridge in late 2022 and, more recently, the acquisition of AAIC. As mentioned over the prior several quarters, these acquisitions would likely be accretive to earnings during 2024. That said, I remain a bit hesitant if these strategies will result in an increase to EFC’s core earnings/EAD back to (or above) $0.39 per common share during 2024.
I would also like to see EFC call the company’s Series E preferred stock (EFC-E) as that specific series has a fixed-to-floating rate feature (“inherited” from the AAIC merger). This series began floating in late March 2024. EFC-E’s effective coupon rate is currently ~11%. This is currently a very high cost of capital. Calling this series of preferred stock would also directly improve future core earnings/EAD per common share.

Ellington Financial preferred share

EFC-A (NYSE:EFC.PR.A) is currently in our overpriced range (but only by $.04):


The stripped yield is currently only 10.09%. The yield on some sites may still show around 6% - 7% because they aren’t factoring in that shares just went to a floating rate:


EFC-A switched to a floating rate on 10/30/2024. Now that shares switched to a floating rate, they will have a yield based on SOFR plus 0.26161% and a floating spread of 5.196%. This is a decent spread, but it’s not one of the highest in the sector. EFC preferred shares carry a moderate amount of risk, so risk-averse investors should consider other options in the sector.
Because of how preferred shares work, the potential upside is likely quite limited here. Investors are generally cautious towards shares that have a negative worst cash to call, and rightfully so. The higher the price of these shares, the worse the worst cash to call becomes. That being said, there is very little reason to believe that shares of EFC-A will see any significant price increase. In the end, there is plenty of downside risk to these shares with minimal potential upside. Investors would mostly be hoping that EFC doesn’t decide to call the shares. Since they haven’t called EFC-E, there’s a decent chance that they won’t call them. But investors aren’t getting compensated very much for taking on the risk.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Ellington Financial’s common stock had a solid quarter, but there is still work to be done. While the company’s acquisitions look promising, there are some challenges going forward. When it comes to the preferred share, EFC-A presents materially more risk than reward in our estimation. Investors should think carefully about the downsides of this preferred share, especially with the better alternatives available in this space. EFC-A just switched to a floating rate. Even though the yield is over 10%, investors should be cautious about a preferred share that carries a material amount of risk.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732354-amazon-3q24-strong-beat-overshadows-rising-temu-risk,4732354,Amazon 3Q24: Strong Beat Overshadows Rising Temu Risk,"Summary

 -  Amazon reported a strong set of results, driven by strength in ecommerce and rising AWS margins.
 -  Deceleration in third-party services implies merchant migration to competing platforms.
 -  Recent Temu restructuring poses a long-term risk to AMZN's e-commerce moat.


Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported a very solid 3Q24 result characterized by accelerating growth in the marketplace, strength in international revenue and margins, expanding margins on AWS, and better-than-expected Q4 guidance. The print was a clean beat across the board and underscores AMZN’s ability to balance growth and investment, particularly in AI.
Consistent with the prior earnings, much of the post-earnings call was focused on AWS margins, capex, and the progression of AI data centers reaching parity with AWS. The marketplace side of the business was once again overlooked and understated.
We believe that many investors in the US and globally take the marketplace's competitive positioning for granted and that the investment community continues to overestimate the economic moat behind AMZN’s e-commerce business. Notably, merchant migration away from AMZN and Temu’s recent restructuring could pose a medium-term threat to AMZN’s marketplace growth.
First, on merchant migration. As we have previously highlighted in our report on PDD (see: PDD: Shop Until You Drop), we believe that Temu has the potential to become a dominant global e-commerce player by first capitalizing on the discount e-commerce vertical that has been largely neglected by the majority of the ex-China e-commerce platforms, and then gradually leverage its traffic and user base to attract brands onto its platform in order to compete with the global incumbents (see: PDD Holdings: Brand Migration Driving Long-Term GMV).
PDD has successfully executed this strategy in China. Over the past six years, we have witnessed PDD surpassing JD and Alibaba in terms of users to become China’s second-largest e-commerce platform in terms of GMV. Temu is likely to replicate a similar strategy to take on AMZN on the global stage.
During AMZN’s call, a question was asked regarding consumer behavior toward lower ASP items, and management acknowledged that lower ASP products had impacts and signs of trade-downs.
Interestingly, management pointed out that “… it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices. And the same thing is probably true about lower ASP items. It's pretty easy to choose to supply them but it's much harder to be able to afford to economically supply them.”
In other words, while it is easy to cut prices, actually doing it in a way that remains profitable is challenging.
We find this surprising, given that AMZN’s scale should allow the platform to access low-cost suppliers and deliver low-cost products at a sustainable level. The only rationale that we can think of is that many of the low-cost suppliers are siding with PDD for China and global cross-border e-commerce opportunities, given the volume growth that PDD offers to merchants.
AMZN's filings show evidence of merchants gradually migrating to PDD. We note that third-party sellers' services revenue continues to decelerate to +10% y/y (down 300bps sequentially) vs. +18% y/y a year ago. Given that Chinese merchants account for the majority of third-party seller services, we suspect merchant migration partially resulted in the growth deceleration in this line item.
Second is the recent restructuring of Temu’s semi-fulfillment model, which warrants investor attention.
Temu’s business model operates on a full fulfillment and a semi-fulfillment model. The full fulfillment model allows merchants to sell the items to Temu so that Temu oversees the product's pricing and fulfillment.
On the other hand, the semi-fulfillment model allows the merchant to oversee the pricing and shipping, while Temu provides storefront and fulfillment support. Temu initially started with a full fulfillment model and launched the semi-fulfillment earlier this year to expedite its expansion overseas, as this is more suitable for overseas merchants where products are based in the local market.
Temu recently restructured its semi-fulfillment model after witnessing strong growth since its launch. The restructuring aims to integrate technical and market analysis teams to deliver more precise service and enhance user experience.
Key changes include:
The merchant acquisition team has been changed from one team focusing on all categories to category-specific teams, such as one team focusing on apparel, the other on cosmetics, and so forth.
Merchant acquisition and buyer group will be combined into a category operations team to facilitate merchant support and conversion. The buyer group was previously more involved in the full-fulfillment model.
Finally, every employee in Temu is taking a crash course and is ongoing in English to improve global communication.
These changes are intended to accelerate product updates, improve user feedback, and allow the platform to respond more effectively to user needs. Additionally, Temu is actively expanding into international markets to attract more cross-border consumers, increasing the diversity and engagement of its user base. When combined with Temu’s ongoing investment in logistics and warehousing to reduce delivery time, Temu’s overall user experience in terms of the value of money, product quality, and delivery time could resonate well amongst global consumers and position Temu competitively against AMZN.
The effectiveness of Temu’s restructuring is also worth considering. If proven to be effective, Temu’s semi-fulfillment model could draw other cross-border e-commerce players, such as Alibaba and TikTok, to replicate similar models in the US, putting further pressure on AMZN as competition intensifies.
In conclusion, we remain bullish on PDD and cautious about AMZN’s long-term ecommerce prospect, given the rising competition from low-cost Chinese players. We believe this is one area that is underappreciated by many investors and could catch many off-guard when AMZN operating metrics start to turn.
The key risk to our thesis remains the U.S. election risk on whether elevated tariffs could make Temu less competitive. However, our view is that retail is a less strategic sector compared with semiconductor and biotech, which warrants greater U.S. government scrutiny.

October finds Verizon (VZ), Dow Inc (DOW), and Intel (INTC), living up to the dogcatcher ideal of annual dividends from $1K invested exceeding single share price.
In late February, Dow Jones replaced the low-priced high-yield dividend payer WBA, with AMZN, a high-priced non-dividend payer. In 2025, the index will replace Intel with Nvidia, a minimal dividend payer.
There are, however, seven more November Dow stocks showing prices within 62% or better of meeting the dog catcher ideal of annual dividends from $1K invested exceeding the single share prices: Cisco Systems (CSCO), Coca-Cola (KO); Chevron (CVX); Merck (MRK); Johnson & Johnson (JNJ); International Business Machines (IBM); Procter & Gamble (PG).
With renewed downside market pressure of 70.4%, it would be possible for all ten of the top dogs to become elite fair-priced dogs with their annual yield (from $1K invested) meeting or exceeding their single share prices.

Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Brokers Expect 15.87% To 34.05% Net Gains From Top-Ten Dow Dogs By November 2025

Five of ten top dividend-yielding Dow dogs (tinted gray in the chart below) were among the top ten price gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. So, this November 2024 yield-based forecast for Dow dogs, as graded by Wall St. wizard estimates, was 50% accurate.
Estimated dividend-returns from $1000 invested in the ten highest-yielding stocks and their aggregate one-year analyst median target prices, as reported by YCharts, created the 2024-25 data points for the projections below. (Note: one-year target-prices estimated by lone analysts were not applied.) Ten probable profit-generating trades projected to November 2025 were:


Merck & Co Inc was projected to net $340.47, based on the median of target price estimates from 27 analysts, plus the estimated annual dividend, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 60% less than the market as a whole.
Microsoft (MSFT) was projected to net $238.23, based on the median of target price estimates from 45 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 9% less than the market as a whole.
Boeing (BA) was projected to net $212.96, based on dividends, plus median target price estimates from 24 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 57% greater than the market as a whole.
Dow Inc was projected to net $201.02 based on the median of target prices estimated by 19 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 24% greater than the market as a whole.
Amazon (AMZN) was projected to net $197.62, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 62 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 14% greater than the market as a whole.
Nike Inc (NKE) was projected to net $196.79, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 34 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 3% greater than the market as a whole.
Verizon Communications was projected to net $177.04, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 23 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 67% under the market as a whole.
Intel Corp was projected to net $174.94, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 34 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 3% over the market as a whole.
Chevron was projected to net $171.43, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 23 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 9% more than the market as a whole.
Coca-Cola was projected to net $158.69 based on the median of target price estimates from 24 analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 38% under the market as a whole.
The average net gain in dividend and price was estimated at 20.69% on $10k invested as $1k in each of these top ten Dow Index stocks. This gain estimate was subject to average risk/volatility 5% more than the market as a whole.



The Dividend Dogs Rule

Stocks earned the ""dog"" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as ""dogs."" More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, ""underdogs"".

The November, 2024 Dow 30 By Yield




Actionable Conclusions (11-20): 10 Top October Dow Dividend Stocks By Yield Ranged 2.44% To 6.43% Per YCharts

Top ten Dow Dogs occupied eight of eleven Morningstar sectors.
The lone communication services dog placed first, Verizon [1], to lead the pack. Then, in second place was the lone basic materials dog, Dow Inc [2]. Another loner from the energy sector was third, Chevron [3].
Two technology sector dogs took the fourth and eighth positions: International Business Machines [4], and Cisco Systems [8].
Three healthcare stocks placed fifth, sixth, and ninth, Johnson & Johnson [5], Merck [6], and Amgen Inc (AMGN) [9].
Finally, two consumer staple stalwarts, placed seventh, and tenth, Coca Cola Co [7], and Procter & Gamble [10], to complete the November Dogs of the Dow by yield.



Dividend Vs. Price Results

A graph above shows the relative strengths of the top ten November Dow dogs by dividend and price as of market close 10/31/2024.
This month eight of the top-ten Dow dogs show a less than ideal status because the prices of those eight exceed the projected annual dividends from $1k invested in each.
A dividend dogcatcher priority is to select stocks whose dividends from $1K invested are greater than their single share price. As mentioned above, that condition was reached by just two of the five lowest priced Dogs of the Dow. Only Verizon, and Dow in the top ten, plus Intel on the outside, lived up to the dogcatcher ideal of annual dividends from $1K invested exceeding single share prices.
However, seven more, Cisco Systems, Coca-Cola Co, Chevron, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, International Business Machines, and Procter & Gamble, showed prices within 61.6% of meeting that goal.

Actionable Conclusion (21): Six of Twenty-Eight Dow Dividend Dogs Show Negative Free Cash Flow Yields



A negative gap between dividend yield and free cash flow yield defines a cash-poor stock. That is, their dividend payout exceeds their cash on hand to pay dividend six are Dow Inc, Intel, Coca-Cola, 3M, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. These are considered unsafe to buy.
Two cut their dividends in the 2020 Ides of March depression times, Boeing (BA), and The Walt Disney Co (DIS). One more snuck onto the Dow index without a dividend.
However, in March Salesforce declared its first-ever quarterly payout and Disney, in January, rejoined the dividend paying ranks. However, nine (seven short on cash and two non-dividend payers, Amazon, and Boeing) cast a pall on the Dow by being stockholder repulsive.
Remember this dogcatcher yield-based stock-picking strategy is contrarian. That means rooting for (buying) the underdog is productive when you don't already own those stocks. If you do hold those stocks, then you must look for opportune pullbacks in price to add to your position to best improve your dividend yield. Plenty of pull-back opportunities appear to be ahead. Dread the Fed.

Price Drops or Dividend Increases Could Get All Ten Dow Dogs Back to ""Fair Price"" Rates For Investors



The charts above retain the current dividend amount and adjust share price to produce a yield (from $1K invested) to equal or exceed the single share price of each stock. As the top illustration shows, one in the top ten is already ideally priced. Beside Verizon, already in the ideal zone, eight more top-yield stocks are within $225.40 of getting there.
The alternative, of course, could be that these companies raise their dividends. That may be too much to ask in these highly disrupted, inflationary, recessionary, yet cash-rich, and volatile times. Mr. Market is far more effective at moving prices up or down to appropriate amounts, just watch and buy when your targeted stock price moves to a sweet spot.



Actionable Conclusions: (22-31) Broker 1-Yr. Targets Showed 13.76% To 32.04% Top Ten Dow Index Upsides To November, 2025; (32) One -3.24% Downsider Emerged

To quantify top-dog rankings, analyst median price-target estimates provided a ""market-sentiment"" gauge of upside-potential. Added to the simple high-yield ""dog"" metrics, analyst median-price target-estimates provided another tool to dig-out bargains.

Analysts Forecast A 29.29% Advantage For 5 Highest-Yield, Lowest-Priced of 10 Dow Dogs As Of November 1, 2025

Ten-top Dow dogs were culled by yield for their monthly-update. Yield (dividend / price) results as verified by YCharts did the ranking.


As noted-above, top-ten Dow dogs selected 10/31/24 by yield, represented seven of eleven sectors. (Real Estate is not reported by the Dow and Utilities has its own Dow Index. Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Industrials also missed the top-ten cut.)

Actionable Conclusions: Analysts Expected 5 Lowest-Priced of the Ten Highest-Yield Dow Dogs (34) To Deliver 18.49% Vs. (35) 14.30% Net Gains by All Ten Come November 1, 2025



$5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top ten Dow Dividend kennel by-yield were predicted by analyst 1-year targets to deliver 29.29% more gain than from $5,000 invested in all-ten. The fifth lowest-priced top ten yielding stock, Merck, showed top analyst-estimated gains of 34.06%.


The five lowest-priced Dow top-yield dogs for November were: Verizon; Dow; Cisco; Cola-Cola; Merck, with prices ranging from $42.13 to $102.32.
Five higher-priced Dow top-yield dogs as of October 31 were: Chevron; Johnson & Johnson; Procter & Gamble; International Business Machines; Amgen, with prices ranging from $148.82 to $320.27.
The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' ""basic method"" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of ""market sentiment"" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market.
Caution is advised, however, since analysts are historically only 15% to 85% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 15% accurate on the degree of change. (In 2017 the market somewhat followed analyst sentiment. In 2018 analysts estimates were contrarian indicators of market performance, and they continued to be contrary for the first two quarters of 2019 but switched to conforming for the last two quarters.) In 2020 analyst projections were quite contrarian.
The first half of 2021 most dividend stock price actions exceeded all analyst expectations. The last half of 2021 was still gangbusters. The 2022 September-December slump freed-up five or more Dow dogs, sending them into the ideal zone where returns from $1k invested equal (or exceed) their single-share price. 2023 continued the slide. A Santa Claus rally staved off the eventual 2024 depression. 3M might have joined the “ideal” four or five, except for it’s decision to spin off an asset that cut its dividend in half. The bubble is inflated but two more dogs are priced right even if their free cash flow is lagging.
As the feckless Fed-fueled slide gains momentum through 2024, with the exception of the few AI tech stocks, look for at least half of the ten Dow Dogs to become Fair-priced… slowly, but surely.

Afterword

Lest there be any doubt about the recommendations in this article, this month there are three Dow Index stocks showing dividends (from $1k invested) exceeding single share price: Verizon, Dow and, Intel. On the downside,a negative gap between dividend yield and free cash flow yield defines a cash-poor stock. That is, their dividend payout exceeds their cash on hand to pay dividends. Six cash poor Dow dogs are, Dow Inc, Intel, Coca-Cola, 3M, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. These are considered unsafe to buy. News has it that Dow index will replace Intel with Nvidia in January

 -  Aflac gets upgraded to Buy from my prior hold rating a year ago, driven by policy growth & retention in Q3 despite net earnings loss.
 -  Although the stock trades near a 10-year-high, it is still undervalued to key peers in terms of fwd P/E and trailing P/B ratios.
 -  A trend of dividend growth looks to continue its sustainability.
 -  The firm has low debt-to-equity vs peers, with strong credit ratings.
 -  Despite a large size of the market, Aflac is in a competitive industry with several large insurance brands to compete with.


Thesis: A Long Term Safer Investment

Today's coverage of insurer Aflac (NYSE:AFL) comes on the heels of its Q3 earnings call on Oct. 30th, where it beat analyst estimates on EPS.
My thesis argues that this stock is a buy because it is an opportunity to get an undervalued stock in a relatively stable/safe sector (insurance) that otherwise has several strong fundamentals in terms of potential future revenue and earnings, as well as its solvency and debt picture.
Key positive and negative factors supporting that thesis include the following, which will be discussed in more detail in this research article:
Of these positive and negative factors, as an analyst thinking about what the share price could do a year from now I would give the greatest weight in this case to top-line growth indicators and a strong profit margin which benefits earnings, whereas the dividend yield may be less consequential than other factors.
The fact that it is trading at a high price to its moving average is offset by the undervaluation to key peers in this sector.

Stock Overview: Large Supplemental Insurer Known for Duck Brand.

According to its official website, Aflac prides itself on being a specialist in ""supplemental insurance"", while their product portfolio spans across the range of life insurance, dental, hospital, and pet insurance, among others.
Its iconic duck mascot, also part of its logo, has remained memorable to those of us who remember Aflac's TV commercials with a talking duck.
A newsworthy item about this firm in the last few months is that it has been ""selected as a 2024 CIO 100 award winner by Foundry's CIO"", recognized for a high level of strategic and operational excellence in IT.
The 4 comparable peers I selected today come from a combination of listed peers of Aflac on Seeking Alpha, as well as data on supplemental insurers from global financial site Yahoo Finance.
I wanted to have a spectrum of peers covering life and supplemental insurance primarily, but that are also traded on major US exchanges, and those include MetLife (MET), Prudential Financial (PRU), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Chubb (CB).

Large & Growing Market Size for Supplemental and Life Insurance

From a June 2024 research study done by Precedence Research, a Canada/India firm in the market insights space with a client list including Morgan Stanley (MS) and GE HealthCare (GEHC), the supplemental health market (critical illness insurance, accident insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, worksite life, dental, etc.) is ""expected to hit around USD 62.57 billion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2033.""


Beyond supplemental insurance, let's consider also the life insurance space, which according to Statista data ""is expected that the gross written premium will show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2029) of 3.61%, resulting in a market volume of US$1.54tn by 2029.""
I think both of these data points are evidence that Aflac will have a large enough market to take advantage of going forward, a positive factor for its investors.

Top-Line Driven by Sales Growth and Retention

In thinking about what could impact earnings for this type of business, consider from its income statement that its largest revenue driver in Q3 came from insurance premiums ($3.3B) while its other revenue drivers include interest/dividend income ($1B) and gains/losses from sales of its investments held.
With that said, I think the largest future impact to the top-line can come from recent growth in insurance policies sold, as it can drive future premiums revenue. In addition, a lesser impact will come from current interest rate trends, which can impact both interest revenue and values of bonds held for sale.
On the cost side, impacts to the bottom line in Q3 seem to have largely come from benefit payouts ($1.59B) and total operating expenses ($2.8B), while the firm's interest expenses are much less significant at $50MM. So, some factors to consider from a forward-looking view are the firm's overall profit margin and whether certain quarters tend to have higher benefit claims.
Although it is worth mentioning from Q3 results that a net loss was posted, the firm's Q3 commentary indicated it was partly driven by investment losses and ""were driven by net losses of $1.4 billion on certain derivatives and foreign currency activities.""
I think that the more important data point when thinking about the future is customer retention, and according to Insuranceopedia the term ""persistency"" refers to the ""percentage that signifies the number of clients that an insurance company has retained for an insurance product.""
As the chart below from the Q3 presentation shows, Aflac shows a trend of persistency above 78% over several quarters in their key geographic segment (US), so over 3/4ths of US customers are sticking with Aflac, indicating a strong likelihood of stable premiums revenue going forward.


In fact, the firm's Q3 commentary was positive when it comes to policy sales growth too in the US:
It's worth mentioning that its other major geographic region, Japan, shows an even better persistency, indicating a strong likelihood of customer (and premiums revenue) stability in that region:


A positive to call out also from Q3 commentary, which, I think, will contribute to future premiums, is the fact that in the Japan region there has been growth in new business:
The firm's CEO Daniel Amos in his Q3 comments also mentioned the growth factors in their Japan region:
I think the beauty of the insurance business model is that a firm can sell a policy once, and as long as that customer remains with you, they will owe premiums, which the insurance firm can count on each year as revenue as long as they keep retaining that customer through policy renewals.

Strong Profit Margin vs Key Peers

In terms of expense trends impacting the bottom line, from the income statement I can see that no single quarter was a major outlier in terms of policy benefit payouts, which remained in the range of $1.59B - $2.15B in the period of Dec. 2022 to Sept. 2024.
In terms of total operating expenses, for that same period, it appears no single quarter was a major outlier to the overall trend.
That brings me to net income margin, and here is my comparison of Aflac vs peers, using peer data from Seeking Alpha:


What we can see from this data is that Aflac's profit margin of +28% clearly beats this peer average by about 140%, which I think indicates a trend of efficient cost management, a crucial factor to consider when thinking about future earnings performance.
This combination of strong profit margin, along with stable/predictable costs, and the fact that Aflac is not exposed to property insurance risk like some P&C insurers who see benefit payouts spike after periods of major weather catastrophes, presents this firm as one with several strong fundamentals to think about.

Strong Dividend Growth & Sustainability, but Yield Unimpressive

The good news for dividend portfolio investors is that Aflac is not only a dividend payer but has a proven track record of growing dividends steadily over a 10-year period.


In his Q3 comments, CEO Amos praised this record and indicated the trend will likely continue in the future, something positive for forward-looking investors who want to grow dividend income:
I think the evidence I presented points to a strong probability the dividend will be sustainable going forward through positive earnings growth indicators, but I should also point out the firm has shown positive free cashflow per share in all of the last 8 quarters.
As for the analyst consensus on earnings, it calls for an 11% YoY EPS growth for fiscal ending December, with 9 upward revisions so far, indicating that others besides myself have also recognized the future earnings potential, which should support the dividend case too.
In terms of dividend yield vs peers, however, here is what that looks like:


From the data, Aflac with its yield of 1.83% trails behind 2 key peers on dividend yield, with a stock like Prudential exceeding 4% yield, something also to think about when considering dividend stocks in this specific sector, which shows Aflac being somewhat less competitive on the yield you get for capital invested.
However, while some dividend investors may care more about yield, I personally would focus more on whether the dividend growth is sustainable, since to a dividend investor that means future income flows each quarter just for holding the stock.

Low Debt to Equity and Strong Credit Ratings

In this section, I want to discuss some risk items like the firm's leverage and capitalization picture.
First, in looking at the following YCharts I created, the data shows Aflac towards the lower end of this peer group with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.32, which, I think, is another positive factor in relation to peers and something for future-minded investors to think about in terms of whether a firm is overly indebted in relation to similar firms in the same sector.


Of course, since insurance is a highly regulated industry, both regulators and customers care about a firm's ability to pay out claims when needed even during spikes in claims, and still remain financially solvent.
Solvency ratio is a key metric we will consider. According to Investopedia:
In that regard, from company Q3 data we can see that the firm boasts ""strong capital ratios"" including a solvency margin ratio consistently above 800% in the period of 2020 -2024, with of course ratios above 100% being a goal to strive for.


When it comes to another risk factor, I would consider credit agency ratings, and Aflac overall as a company has seen agencies like S&P and Moody's give ratings of A- and A3, respectively, on the firm's long-term debt.


I think all of these data points discussed in this section paint the picture of a lower-risk firm to invest in, when it comes to its debt and solvency picture, and I think with strong credit ratings like this it places Aflac in a stronger position to get more favorable financing terms going forward, which could mean lower debt costs too in the future. Interest expenses, after all, affect net income.

Share Price Near 10-Year High, but Generally Still Undervalued

In today's article, I prefer to leave a discussion of price and valuation towards the end here after having covered the other fundamentals.
My prior coverage of Aflac exactly a year ago in Nov. 2023 called for holding on, and since then, the share price is up +30%, currently trading not only well above its 200-day SMA but also near its 10-year price high, as well as a 1-year momentum close to that of the S&P500 index.


At the time of my hold rating, I admit that I was hesitant to call it a buy due to its high share price vs moving average, as well as what, I thought, was overvaluation at the time based on data points used at the time, so perhaps it may have been an overly conservative estimate and playing it too safe. Nevertheless, if you did end up agreeing with me and ""holding"" this stock, you are now seeing a 30% share price growth in 1 year.
However, to get a better sense of where to go with it from here, let's talk about some new valuation metrics briefly.
From GAAP-based forward P/E ratios from SA peer data, I created this worksheet which shows that Aflac is undervalued by 31% to this peer average, on this specific metric.


To add another angle to the valuation picture, considering that Aflac has a relatively large balance sheet with around $90B in debt securities, along with having $128.4B in total assets, lets looking at the current price/book value compared to peers, also using SA data:


From this data, we can see that Aflac is undervalued to this peer group by 10%, in terms of trailing P/B ratio.
Both of these valuation metrics indicate that despite a bullish share price, the stock shows undervaluation in relation to this specific peer group. However, SA data indicates its forward P/E ratio is undervalued to the overall sector itself as well.
Whereas SA data shows its trailing P/B ratio is actually higher than the overall sector, keep in mind that the ""sector"" may include many firms in the financial segment that are not exactly great comparables to Aflac's business, but can be considered in the same financial/insurance sector overall.
I think a key impact to many investors' sentiment driving undervaluation vs peers could be Aflac's net loss in Q3, and we can see from the price chart the stock took a dip recently, however there was still enough support to keep it from diving below its moving average.

Risk Chart: Competition is a Key Factor

To visualize 4 key risks and their weighted-impact on this stock, I created the following risk chart, similar to some of my recent articles.


From the evidence presented today, I would give the greatest risk weight to the fact that Aflac has to compete with several major insurance brands for business, many of whom are well-established and can easily sell a lot of the same insurance products Aflac does, while some of them like Prudential and MetLife go beyond insurance to also diversify into annuities/retirement planning and investments.
An offsetting factor to market competition is the evidence I showed of the vast size of the market that shows future growth potential, both in supplemental and life insurance, so Aflac has a large pond to swim in.
The lowest risk weight I gave is to Aflac's debt risk, as evidence supports this being a low-risk factor.
Interest rate risk is a factor for investors to consider from a future-view, since it can impact both future interest income but also values of underlying bonds that Aflac holds, yet is affected largely by Fed decisions which are outside of Aflac's control.
Although we have seen the Fed's rates come down in September, it is impossible to know for certainty what they will decide a year or two from now, since it also depends on inflation data and other macro factors which could keep changing.
What we do know in the short term, according to an Oct. 29th article from Nasdaq, points to the likelihood of more rate cuts soon:

Conclusion: Agree with Buy Consensus

To summarize today's research article, this stock presents an undervaluation opportunity to buy into a relatively safe business, insurance, and a company with evidence of strong fundamentals and positive forward-looking indicators.
At the same time, investors should still be cautious of the fact that stiff competition exists in the insurance sector from big brands, and the external unknown factor of Fed decisions on interest rates can impact the fixed-income portfolio of assets that insurers typically hold.
Therefore, I'm upgrading my prior hold rating and agreeing with today's consensus from SA analysts, showing a buy rating on this stock's profile page.

BDC PSEC has upsized its preferred issuance cap to $2.5bn, with $1.8bn already issued. The company is obviously extending its strategy to source financing via the preferreds channel - it’s the only BDC of decent size which is doing this. The benefit to the company as discussed earlier is that preferreds dividends don’t reduce GAAP net investment income and preferreds don’t count as debt, allowing PSEC to keep its leverage low.
The downside is that the preferreds are more expensive than debt, so the company’s net investment income due to common shareholders is lower than it would have been otherwise. And while the preferred may be attractive for holders given the fixed value, the equity coverage is ultra-low at 2x and will be 1.6x if the issuance moves up to the new cap. By comparison, the Agency mortgage REIT preferreds discussed the other week have coverage of 6-10x at higher yields.

Market Commentary

BDCs didn't start off well on the week, with the sector falling around 1%. PFLT was the worst performer in coverage, falling close to 4%. The valuation on this stock has always been puzzling - it’s a longer-term underperformer and yet has continued to trade above the median valuation and still does. On our combined performance and valuation metric it is not very attractive at all.


This week we also saw three lock-up expiries touching MSDL, NCDL and OBDE. As expected, the stocks underperformed on the day, falling around 2%. By the end of the week, they managed to recover some of the lost ground, however. All three are attractive at current levels of a 5%, 5% and 7% discount, respectively. At a 10% discount or more, all would be strong buys.
Next week will bring the start of the BDC reporting season. Early indication is that portfolio quality should hold up well, while net investment income is likely to remain stable as the Fed's rate cut will only make itself known next year.

By Ryan McMaken
According to the most recent report from the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added only 12,000 payroll jobs during October. This was the smallest month-to-month employment gain in nearly four years. Moreover, total private jobs fell in October by 28,000.
This is the worst employment report since 2020, and it reflects an overall downward trend in employment growth since 2022. In addition to the drop in private employment, the report also shows drops in full-time employment and ongoing stagnation in the total number of employed workers.
This is an economy in which whatever lackluster growth there is in employment, it’s being driven by part-time jobs and taxpayer-funded government workers.

Government Jobs vs. Private Employment

Total government jobs grew by 40,000 during October, meaning total job growth for the month would have been negative were it not for the immense amounts of deficit spending that props up growth in government hiring. This has been a growing trend over the past year. Proportionally, government jobs over the year have grown one-and-a-half times more than private sector jobs.
For most of the past year, however, there were - at least according to the establishment survey - some gains in private employment. But that wasn’t the case in October, meaning private employment fell in October for the first time in 46 months.


But, 12,000 more people had jobs in October than in September, right? Not quite. That number comes out of the so-called “establishment” survey, which counts only jobs, but not employed workers.
According to the federal government’s other employment survey - the household survey - the total number of employed workers in the United States fell in October, month over month, by 368,000 workers.


Over time, this has led to stagnation in total employment in the household survey numbers. Over the past eighteen months, total employed workers has gone nowhere, and as of October, there are 370,000 fewer employed workers in the United States than there were eleven months ago:


Yet, over this period, total jobs in the establishment survey has grown by more than 2 million jobs. So why are there job gains in the establishment survey but job losses in the household survey? One probable explanation is that much of the job growth we see is driven by part-time jobs and by people holding more than one job to make ends meet.
Not surprisingly, the household survey does indeed show that full-time employment fell in October, both month-to-month and year-over year. Part-time jobs, on the other hand, continued an upward trend in growth, year over year.
In fact, year-over-year full-time job growth has now been negative for nine months in a row, for the past thirty years, that has only happened when the economy is in recession:


There is other bad news in the report, as well. Temp jobs continue their long march downward, and total temp work is now at the lowest level reported in more than a decade. Year-over-year, temp work has been down for two full years. For more than thirty years, this has only happened during recessions.
Average weekly overtime hours remained at 3.6 hours in October. For more than 30 years, average overtime has been at this level only during recessions. The total number of permanent job losers also spiked in October, rising to the highest level reported - outside the covid crisis - in 90 months.
These jobs numbers weren’t the only bad news released on Friday, either. The PMI manufacturing index, released by the Institute for Supply Management, fell to 46.5 percent.
This was the lowest reading of the year, showing “economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in October for the seventh consecutive month.” The report showed new orders, production, and employment were all in contraction territory during October.

Will the Fed Panic Again?

The question that now faces markets is this: what will the Federal Reserve do in response to the October job report? The bond markets may give us a hint.
On Friday, after the release of the jobs report, the 10-year yield rose quickly to a four-month-high. Overall, the yield curve steepened on Friday as the 5-year, the 10-year and the 30-year also all experienced significantly rising yields.
This strongly suggests that bond investors expect the Fed, in the face of increasingly bad economic data, will totally throw in the towel on its alleged war against price inflation.
With government debt levels at nosebleed levels, and now with this jobs report, there is every reason to believe that the Fed simply doesn’t have the stomach to do anything but lower the target policy rate in an effort to keep government debt cheap and to stimulate the job market.
That points to rising price inflation, and that points to rising yields in the longer term. Thus, we now see that rise in the 10-year and 30-year bonds.
The bond markets are probably right. At this point, it’s nearly a sure thing that the Fed will cut the target rate by at least 25 basis points, as already expected. After all, at the September meeting, following a middling jobs report that was better than this one, the Fed panicked and chopped 50 basis points off the target rate. It may do so again.
This all points to a hard pivot toward more dovish policy and more price inflation moving forward. Of course, price inflation could fall in coming months. But that won’t be thanks to the Fed, it would be thanks to recession and a collapse in demand.
On the other hand, given the immense amounts of monetary inflation that has occurred over the past four years, we could get both recession and ongoing inflation. Then we’ll get stagflation. The bond markets seem to be entertaining the possibility.

Intro & Thesis

I initiated coverage of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in August 2024 with a 'Buy' recommendation on the stock before it reports for its fiscal Q2 FY2025. At the time, I assumed that despite some obvious challenges, CRM's strategic acquisitions and AI technology developments could drive growth and help the firm exceed market expectations. As history has shown, my bullish call was correct and CRM outperformed the broad market significantly for this short period of time:


After the fiscal Q2 report, I was only reinforced in my thesis. Moreover, despite the recent growth, I believe that CRM stock has only become cheaper, no matter what skeptics say, while the tailwind for further business expansion has not diminished. In this regard, I am reiterating my ""Buy"" rating today.

Why Do I Think So?

From what I see, Salesforce's Q2 FY2025 report revealed an era of transformation and strategic urgency – especially when it comes to AI and efficiency. CRM generated ~$9.33 billion in revenue – up 8% YoY or 9% YoY in constant currency, beating the consensus expectations. This top-line growth, while a little less than the 11% that we saw last year, was fueled by strong performances across the Service Cloud and multi-cloud deals, accounting for almost 80% of new business. The Service Cloud had a 10% YoY growth and Marketing and Commerce 6% YoY growth. I think this discrepancy reflects Salesforce's continued move toward AI and data solutions, which are becoming increasingly the core of its business model, which I find beneficial in the longer term.
The company's remaining performance obligation (RPO), which represents future revenues, rose 15% to $53.5 billion and the current RPO ((cRPO)) climbed by 10% to $26.5 billion - this expansion is slower than previous quarters due to the wider macroeconomic conditions and dovish customer behavior, but in spite of that, CRM's continued focus on multi-cloud solutions and AI-powered innovations have kept sales pipeline healthy.
I also like the firm's cost control during the quarter. The non-GAAP operating income increased 15.5% to $3.14 billion and its non-GAAP operating margin increased 210 basis points to 33.7%. As the executives explained during the earnings call, this growth is due to ""continued reorganization efforts and a sharp focus on cost management as part of a broad industry shift toward profitability in the face of declining revenues."" So as a result, the company's non-GAAP diluted EPS rose 21% YoY to $2.56, also beating the consensus figure - a further testament to its sound financial control, in my view.
One of the most prominent announcements of the second quarter was the release of Agentforce, a platform for creating customizable generative AI agents. This platform was scheduled to be generally available in October this year and would represent an enormous advancement in Salesforce's AI capabilities, as per management's commentary. I think with Salesforce's extensive data cloud and AI platforms, Agentforce should enable customers to automate and enhance their experiences across various verticals, bringing more growth to CRM's RPO. The promise of the platform was evident in their pilot programs with Wiley and OpenTable, which saw increases in both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Wiley, for example, increased case resolution by 50%, and OpenTable was able to scale customer service more efficiently.
Salesforce AI not only brings in innovation but also a strategic business imperative: The firm has found that many of its customers face difficulties attempting DIY AI solutions, which tend to yield suboptimal results. With its fully integrated AI platform, CRM aims to offer high-performance AI without the need for advanced model training to its customers. It will likely result in high productivity enhancements and business efficiency improvements for Salesforce's clients and could make the firm the dominant AI-powered enterprise software provider.
Based on what I see in sell-side analysts' notes (Argus Research and Morningstar Premium, proprietary sources), they generally have a favorable outlook for Salesforce, particularly given its aggressive AI and data-driven approach. The company's deep enterprise customer base and high-tech leadership are perceived as the company's strong points, enabling it to take a significant portion of the burgeoning AI market. However, there are worries about AI disruption and competition, with competitors such as ServiceNow (NOW) also exploring generative AI.
I think Salesforce's primary commercial strength is its integrated CRM platform which integrates multiple offerings such as sales, service, marketing, and commerce in 1 place. This hybrid approach gives clients a 360-degree customer experience, creating highly individualized and intelligent customer experiences. Also, its industry-specific offerings and the company's ability to harness its deep data cloud are also considered competitive advantages.
They were indeed struggling to sustain growth in the face of macro uncertainty and evolving customer needs: Deal cycles are extending, and spending is more closely monitored than ever before, especially in Salesforce's biggest end market (the United States). But Salesforce's management still forecasts a solid FY2025 revenue growth of 8-9% (higher than before) and a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.8%, a 230 basis point improvement from FY2024. The company also expects a 22.5% increase in non-GAAP EPS thanks to the strategic investments in AI and data cloud technology:


The company's outlook predicts that the total available market (TAM) will grow at 13% CAGR to $290 billion by 2026. Since CRM is focusing on large customers as its key growth channel, leveraging a land-and-expand approach should help it generate incremental revenues from its installed base, in my opinion. Also, Salesforce's partnerships and acquisitions, including with MuleSoft, Tableau, and Slack, should help fuel this expansion by growing its platform and global footprint.
Coming back to CRM's financials, I'd like to note its great financial strength and strong cash flow generation capacity. As of Q2 data, the company possessed ~$12.6 billion in cash and convertible securities, which gave CRM great latitude for strategic investments and acquisitions. They held ~$8.4 billion in long-term debt while having a debt rating of 'A+/Stable' according to S&P, representing a solid and investment-grade profile.


Salesforce's free cash flow demonstrates its capability to create significant cash post-capital expenditures with $755 million FCF for Q2 FY2025, which is up 20% year-over-year. The firm has also been returning capital through share buybacks and dividends, with $4.3 billion in share buybacks and nearly $400 million in dividends paid in the quarter.


Salesforce began paying its first quarterly cash dividend ($0.40 per share) in February, and Wall Street consensus forecasts a dividend of $1.61 for FY2025 as a whole and $1.70 for FY2026:


So when adding to the above small dividend yield of 0.55% the part of buybacks, we get a total shareholder's return of about 4%, according to my calculations - that's a great yield for a growth stock, in my opinion, which may speak of existing undervaluation.
Since I touched upon CRM's valuation, let me show you that the stock is now actually the cheapest it's ever been: The forwarding P/E of now 28.8x, according to YCharts data, has managed to fall off its peak by almost 39% (since 2022). So the multiple contraction takes place amid rising margins and absolute EPS figures.


In addition, we see that the multiple contraction process is projected to keep going well into calendar 2025 and 2026, with P/E eventually reaching 23x:


According to Seeking Alpha data, Salesforce's key valuation multiples are still trading at substantial premiums, but on the other hand, compared to 3 months ago, the stock's valuation has become significantly more attractive. Meanwhile, analysts' earnings forecasts for Salesforce have only improved:


I believe that if the company exceeds current EPS forecasts by ~5% for the fiscal FY2026 and the stock continues to trade at its current P/E multiple, its fair value today would be $337.80/share. This suggests a potential growth opportunity of about 16%.
So based on all of the above, I decided to reiterate my ""Buy"" rating after CRM's Q2 earnings.

Where Can I Be Wrong?

The risk factors I noted last time didn't go anywhere. While I'm quite confident about the future of Salesforce, there are a few things that could make my bullish stance wrong.
First of all, as I briefly mentioned above, the end market where CRM operates seems to be highly competitive and dynamically evolving. So Salesforce has to constantly innovate its products as it faces stiff competition not just from ServiceNow, but also from companies like Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, SAP, Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, IBM (IBM), and some smaller, sometimes more agile competitors.
Another problem I see is Salesforce's high valuation, which reflects the company's success as a growth company, but also makes it vulnerable to market changes. In my above calculations, I assumed that the current multiple may hold if the firm keeps beating projections. But as the CRM stock still trades at relatively high multiples, even a small financial underperformance can lead to a significant drop in the market cap. So my calculations of its fair value may be out of touch with reality.
Also, data privacy is now of great importance to both Salesforce's reputation and customer confidence - releasing customer data without consent poses a significant risk to the company's image and requires stricter privacy policies in America or even abroad.

The Bottom Line

Despite the risks I described above, I can say with confidence that the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which the company presented at the end of August, have strengthened my conviction that my initial bullish rating was correct. It is not just a matter of having predicted the behavior of the stock; the stock's appreciation over the last quarter has a solid fundamental basis. The end market in which Salesforce operates offers numerous opportunities despite its competitiveness. The company's strategic moves, including acquisitions and organic development of internal products, indicate that Salesforce is well-prepared to compete with any rival. Furthermore, in my observation, the company is now more attractively valued than ever when looking at its key valuation multiples. Growth has slowed somewhat, but margins continue to increase and management is confident that this trend will continue. I have therefore decided to maintain my ""Buy"" rating today.

 -  Verra Mobility delivered solid 3Q24 results, driven by strong growth in its core segments, Commercial Services and Government Solutions.
 -  The company's growth prospects remain strong, supported by the continued recovery in domestic travel and the expansion of government programs.
 -  Valuation is now cheaper, which makes the risk reward situation more attractive.


Investment overview

I wrote about Verra Mobility Corp. (NASDAQ:VRRM) previously (July 2024) with a hold rating as the valuation was expensive, albeit I thought the business model was very attractive. I upgraded my rating from hold to buy as valuation has become cheaper today. The fundamentals remain solid, in my view, wherein the largest segments of VRRM (CS and GS) should continue to perform in the near term.

3Q24 earnings (announced on 31st October)

In the 3Q24 quarter, total revenue saw $225.6 million, with $217.3 million from service revenue and the rest from product revenue. By end market type, commercial services [CS] revenue saw $109.1 million; government solutions [GS] saw $90.3 million, and parking solutions saw $21.5 million. This represented a total revenue y/y growth of 7.5%. Gross margin came slightly below expectations at 95.12% vs. 95.33%, which led to the minor miss in EBITDA expectations ($104.69 million vs. $106.5 million). By end market, CS and GS segments continue to be the main profit drivers, as CS contributed $72.87 million in EBITDA and GS contributed $28.09 million.

CS revenue growth outlook remains steady

The growth outlook remains attractive as the underlying demand for domestic travel is still strong. While management guidance for the CS segment is to grow FY25 revenue at the low end of the 6-8% range, I believe this should serve as a baseline to think of FY25 growth and beyond. For what it’s worth, I think management is guiding safely for FY25, as the Transportation Security Administration [TSA] did estimate that FY25 passenger volume growth to be 4.5%, which represents a moderation back to normalized level (the average of pre-covid period 2014-2019). The reason I remain optimistic is because I expect travel growth to be stronger than expected, as inferred from the comments from several domestic airlines that demand remains sound. Translating this to revenue growth for the segment, if travel demand comes in stronger than expected (i.e., on the back of recovering consumer spending confidence, which is still low today), VRRM could report stronger-than-expected growth.
Outside the US, VRRM is also gaining momentum in Europe (a key growth driver for the segment). Just a few weeks ago, VRRM announced they had managed to clinch the major deal with two major global rental car companies to offer its services in Italy. This lends credence that VRRM can actually continue to win contracts (note they have previously won contracts in Ireland and Spain).



Outlook for GS segment remains healthy too

There were no signs of growth slowdown in the GS segment as VRRM continues to expand programs with existing clients and win new deals, wherein new contracts drove around $22 million of incremental ARR (annual recurring revenue) (including a large deal with Hayden AI that was worth $8 million in ARR). Looking ahead, I think the most important growth driver to note is further expansion in California. For reference, the current 6-city pilot phase is worth ~$125 million, and management estimate is for this TAM to double if more cities are to be included. If that happens, which I believe it will because of the value proposition that speed cameras can reduce traffic accidents (related to speeding), VRRM will be well positioned to win more deals given its history with working with the US government. The fact that VRRM won the contract in San Francisco (California’s first automated speed safety program) is a testament that VRRM is a very strong candidate.
There is also another visible growth catalyst that should materialize in 2025—the RFP results in New York City, which is expected to come to a conclusion in 2025 (per the earnings transcript). Management currently guides for flat y/y revenue growth for New York City (as they await the outcome), which means any renewal of contract (supposedly with new pricing terms) would mean upside to guidance. Moreover, the NY Governor had also recently signed legislation to increase its red-light program to 450 intersections, which, if VRRM gets to renew the contract, should mean that VRRM gets to implement this red-light program (a new source of revenue).



Valuation



Management largely reiterated their FY24 guidance, and I did not make any changes to my FY24 estimates. However, to be conservative, I did revise my FY25 growth estimates down to 6% to reflect management’s guidance for the CS segment (albeit I see upside to it, depending on how strong domestic travel is). My view of earnings margins has not changed as well; in that, I still expect margins to gradually recover to pre-covid levels over time.
The key update to my model is that I have included the value of the FCF generated in FY25/26 into my target share price calculation. I have previously overlooked the cash generation ability of VRRM. Using consensus FCF estimates and my assumption that VRRM will keep this cash on the balance sheet (since leverage is going to stay at 2x and VRRM is already near this target level, which means no major cash outflow to pay down debt), this should result in another $2.75 of value.
Although there are catalysts that may drive upside to growth, assuming that VRRM trades at its historical average of 18x forward PE, I see an upside of 22%.



Risk

Domestic travel may be much poorer than I believed if the consumer spending environment sees more headwind from the macro environment. The growth catalysts mentioned above are largely independent of how well VRRM can execute, given that the government is the one making the decisions. There is no guarantee that the government will act according to my or management’s timeline, which may result in growth being pushed back.

Conclusion

I give a buy rating for VRRM as I am positive on both the CS segment (due to the domestic travel demand strength) and the GS segment (VRRM continues to win/renew contracts). In particular for the GS segment, VRRM won a key contract in San Francisco, which bodes well for it to win other contracts. Notably, VRRM valuation has also become slightly more attractive, and if I include the value of the expected FCF in FY25/26, the upside is quite attractive.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732329-hexcel-valuation-slightly-stretched-despite-enduring-tailwinds,4732329,Hexcel: Valuation Slightly Stretched Despite Enduring Tailwinds,"Summary

 -  In 3Q24, Hexcel posted a strong set of earnings and generated $456.5 million in revenues and $73 million in FCF, representing a YoY increase of 8.81% and 48% respectively.
 -  Hexcel is well positioned to enjoy enduring tailwinds such as strong demand from commercial aircraft manufacturing and a surge in defense spending.
 -  Cashflow analysis suggests that Hexcel is able to generate sustainable cashflows. Moreover, the company has been returning value to shareholders consistently.
 -  Unfortunately, valuation analysis suggests that there is a low margin of safety. Currently, there is a potential downside of 25%.


Introduction

Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) is an industrials company that specializes in producing composite materials. Currently, the company operates through the following segments: (1) Commercial Aerospace, (2) Space & Defense, and (3) Industrials. Commercial aerospace is the company's biggest segment, contributing about 64.8% of the company's total revenue. HXL's Space & Defense and Industrial segments contributes about 28.10% and 7.1% respectively.


HXL had posted a strong set of earnings in 3Q24 and its business is likely to continue benefit from multiple tailwinds such as: (1) persistent demand from commercial aircraft manufacturing and (2) surge in defense spending amidst a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. Moreover, the company has been a strong cashflow generator and consistently returns value to its shareholders through repurchases and dividends. However, my valuation analysis suggests that HXL is slightly overvalued. In this report, I will demonstrate why investors should closely monitor HXL and start accumulating only when HXL provide more color on margin optimization.

Latest Developments

In 3Q24, HXL generated $456.50 million in revenues, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.81% and a quarter-on-quarter decrease of -8.60%. During this period, HXL revenue missed consensus topline estimates by $4.81 million. However, EPS came in at $0.46, beating estimates by $0.01. Growth in revenues is primarily attributable to the company's strength in the commercial aerospace segment, where revenues increased by 17.5%. However, space & defense and industrial fell by 0.50% and 16.50% respectively.
On a year-on-year basis, gross and operating margins improved from 21.90% and 10.48% in the same period last year to 23.41% and 11.60% this quarter respectively. However, net income margin deteriorated to 8.75% this quarter from 9.29% in the same period last year. Free cashflow improved significantly; the company generated $73 million this quarter as compared to 48% the same period last year, representing a year-on-year growth of 52%.


Although the company withdrew guidance for FY2024, HXL remains optimistic about FY2024. For FY2024, the company expects to post revenues of $1.98 billion, representing a growth of 10.68% year-on-year. Revenue growth will continue to be driven by commercial aerospace. However, space & defense and industrials will see slight growth of mid-single digits and deterioration of low double digits respectively. After accounting for capital expenditures of about $100 million, HXL expects to generate $200 million in free cash flow by the end of FY2024.

Key Drivers for Composite Materials Will Provide Long-Term Tailwinds

As a core supplier to manufacturers of commercial airspace such as Boeing and Airbus, the strength of the industry is important to HXL's outlook. As a reference, HXL generates more than 60% of its revenues from commercial airspace.


More importantly, the drivers for the production of commercial aircraft persist. According to Airbus's (OTCPK:EADSF) latest global market forecast, the demand for capacity is expected to grow, and passenger traffic is likely to experience an 8.4% growth per year between 2024 and 2027.


Overall, airlines are expected to require more than 40k new aircraft between 2024 and 2043 (i.e., 2.2k new aircraft per year). Currently, Airbus has a backlog of 8,749 aircrafts while Boeing (BA) has a backlog of 5,400 aircraft. According to HXL, these backlogs represent a total of $9 billion in sales to the company.


In addition, HXL also provides composite materials to military aircraft ranging from fighter jets such as the state-of-the-art F-35 to helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache. About 30% of HXL's revenue is derived from space and defense spending. As geopolitical tensions across the world continue to deteriorate, global military spending has surged and is expected to continue growing in the near future.

HXL Has Been Consistently Returning Value to Shareholders

Ever since the company's operations normalized post Covid-19, HXL has been consistently giving back to its shareholders. Since March 2022, the company has returned a total of $397 million through dividends and share repurchases. That being said, it is important to note that the company has to return more than its cumulative free cash flow and net income of $304 million and $361 million respectively. Hence, it will be important for us to closely monitor the company's liquidity levels to ensure that HXL will be able to consistently return to shareholders at these levels. Fortunately, the company has a current ratio of 2.76x, which is still fairly healthy.


Recently, the Board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. In addition, Hexcel has acquired $50 million worth of common shares in 3Q24. On a year-to-date basis, the company has already purchased up to $252.2 million. Currently, based on the share repurchase program, HXL still has about $234.9 million remaining under authorization for repurchase.

Although HXL Has Strong Cashflow Generation Capabilities, The Company's Valuation is Stretched

Historically, HXL has been a strong free cash flow generator and has not posted a negative free cash flow since December 2015. In the past 10 years, the company has generated a total of $1.38 billion in free cash flow. Looking forward, HXL is likely to maintain its cashflow generation capabilities. Based on the following assumptions: (1) HXL generates a revenue of 10.68% between FY2024 and FY2028, (2) maintain its current average 4 quarter margins, and (3) has capital expenditures of approximately 5% of its revenues, HXL will be able to generate about $1.2 billion in free cash flow.


Based on the assumptions noted above with the following assumptions: (1) terminal growth of 2%, (2) WACC of 11.38%, and (3) outstanding shares of 81 million shares, the implied share price of the company is $43.59, suggesting that the current valuation of HXL is overstretched with a potential downside of 25%.


To justify its share price, the company must be able to enhance its operating margins or generate revenues more than 10.68%. Unfortunately, the company is currently increasing the number of its staff to prepare for an increase in production; hence, the earlier overstaffing is likely to become a near-term margin headwind. All else equal, in terms of revenue growth, HXL must generate a growth of more than 15% between FY2024 and FY2028, severely exceeding management's FY2024 estimates of 10.68%.

Closing Remarks

Overall, HXL remains a strong a company that will continue to benefit from the structural tailwinds such as the demand from commercial aircraft manufacturing and surge in defense spending. In addition, the company's has robust fundamentals and has been able to generate cashflows consistently.
Unfortunately, the share price of the company remains stretched, and it will be wise for us to remain on the sidelines. Looking ahead, we should closely monitor information on how HXL can optimize its margins. If the company is able to optimize its margins, there will be tremendous upside for investors.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732325-amazon-road-to-325,4732325,Amazon: Road To $325,"Summary

 -  Amazon reported better than expected Q3'24 earnings, driven by strength in e-Commerce, but especially in Cloud.
 -  Amazon beat both top and bottom-line earnings by wide margins. The biggest take-away from the earnings report was that AWS-related operating income is surging.
 -  The firm's guidance for Q4 is solid. The fourth-quarter includes shopping events like Black Friday as well as the Christmas holidays which should lead to a boost platform spend.
 -  Shares of Amazon are the most expensive in the big tech group, but have potential for top line and operating income growth.
 -  I see a long term (FY 2027) fair value of $325 per-share, driven by growth in Amazon Web Services.


Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) soared 6% and closed in on $200 after the e-Commerce and Cloud company reported better than expected third-quarter results on Thursday. I was especially impressed with Amazon Cloud segment which is seeing strong (operating income) growth and I see considerable upside potential if Amazon keeps performing at its current level. Shares, although they have delivered strong returns so far in the last year, could revalue higher on incremental operating income gains and strength in consumer spending which would chiefly benefit the e-Commerce business. Amazon's guidance calls for up to 11% top line growth year-over-year in Q4'24 and shares have considerable upside revaluation potential.



Previous rating

I rated shares of Amazon a strong buy in my last work on the retail giant in August -- This Is The Time To Be Greedy -- due to its dominant position in Cloud and an impressive overall performance in e-Commerce. I believe that AI opportunities are going to define the direction of Amazon’s shares going forward, and the company is well-positioned to utilize AI technology in its Cloud business to help corporate customers achieve their productivity goals. I also see a strong case for operating income upside, especially in Amazon Web Services. With a strong holiday season likely on the horizon, I expect shares of Amazon to advance to new highs in the coming months.

Amazon beat Q3'24 expectations, Amazon Web Services on track to achieve $50B in operating income in FY 2025

Amazon beat top and bottom-line expectations for its third-quarter on Thursday by big margins: the retail and Cloud company reported adjusted earnings of $1.43 per-share for Q3’24 which beat the consensus estimate by $0.29 per-share. The top line came in at $158.9B, beating the average prediction by $1.6B.


Amazon delivered very satisfying results in both the e-Commerce and the Cloud business. In total, the e-Commerce giant reported revenue of $158.9B, showing 11% top-line growth and a 1 PP revenue growth acceleration compared to the second-quarter. Amazon also out-performed its Q3’24 revenue guidance of $154.0-158.5B by approximately $400M. Amazon benefited from strong growth across its business segments, with Amazon Web Services growing the fastest (+19% Y/Y), followed by International e-Commerce (+12% Y/Y) and e-Commerce North America (+9% Y/Y).


Amazon Web Services is crushing it right now in terms of revenue and operating income growth. In the third fiscal quarter, Amazon generated $27.5B in revenue from its Cloud offering, showing 19% year-over-year growth. Compared to the year-earlier period, Amazon saw a 7 PP growth acceleration here. This segment benefits from a growing customer base as well as enhanced service offers that include the use of AI technology.


The most important take-away from the earnings release was that the segment’s operating income is growing almost two-and-a-half time as fast as its top line, which is boosting Amazon's total consolidated operating income growth. In total, Amazon earned $17.4B in operating income in the third-quarter, showing 55% year-over-year growth and the majority of this growth comes from Amazon Web Services.
Amazon Web Services' revenue and operating income trends looks like this:
(Source: Author)
On an annualized basis, Amazon Web Services is set to achieve $110B in revenues. With the current growth that the segment is experiencing (~20%), Amazon Web Services could generate $125-130B in revenue in FY 2025.
Amazon's growth in AWS is also extremely profitable: in the September quarter, the segment's operating income margin reached 38% compared to 30% in the year-earlier period. If my revenue target for FY 2025 is valid ($125-130B) and Amazon maintains its current margin profile, then Amazon could be on track to achieve $47.5-49.5B in operating, just from Amazon Web Services.

Guidance for Q4'24

Amazon expects to earn $181.5-188.5B in revenue in the fourth-quarter, implying up to 11% growth. Since the fourth-quarter includes shopping holidays like Black Friday, I believe Amazon has a good chance of out-performing even the top-end of its guidance.

Road to $325

Shares of Amazon have seen a sharp revaluation to the upside in the last year and are therefore not cheap. In fact, Amazon is the most expensive big tech stock that investors can buy (excluding semiconductor companies).
Amazon is delivering actual, real-world operating income and earnings growth that can sustain further valuation gains, in my opinion. Amazon is currently valued at a forward P/E ratio of 32.9X, which is above the big tech group industry average of 25.5X. Now that we are in the fourth-quarter, typically a very good one for retail companies, I believe shares of Amazon could benefit from sustained valuation growth. Inflation has declined massively in the last several months, freeing up consumer spending that could especially help Amazon's e-Commerce business.
In my last article, I stated that I calculated a twelve-months price target of $202 per-share for Amazon due to the company's consistent growth in both its e-Commerce and Cloud business. This fair value target, which was based off of a fair value P/E ratio of 35X, has almost been reached (Amazon's share price currently is $198). In the longer term, however, I expect Amazon's shares to head significantly higher.
If Amazon grows its EPS at an average annual rate of 25% in the next three years, the e-Commerce company could be on track to earn ~$9.25 per-share in FY 2027 (calculated off of a base year FY 2024 estimate of $4.74 per-share). Applying a 35X fair value P/E ratio -- which is about in-line with Amazon's long-term average P/E ratio -- implies a fair value of $325 per-share and a fair value market cap of $3.4T. The main catalyst that could lift Amazon's shares to this valuation level, by the end of FY 2027, is the firm's excellent operating income growth in Amazon Web Services.



Risks with Amazon

Amazon is focused on e-Commerce and Cloud operations, but e-Commerce still represents the biggest chunk of revenues (83%) for the company. So while the growth drivers of Amazon Web Services (growing demand for Cloud applications and workloads) seem to be intact, e-Commerce will continue to dominate Amazon's revenue mix. A down-turn in the economy could therefore suppress Amazon's EPS growth and potentially remove a potent valuation catalyst for Amazon's shares.

Final thoughts

Amazon delivered an excellent earnings sheet for its third fiscal quarter on Thursday, and the company beat its own revenue projection (as well as consensus estimates). Amazon Web Services did especially well, making much progress in terms of growing its operating income. Amazon Web Services is crushing it here as the segment expanded its operating income margins to a massive 38% in Q3'24. Amazon could be on track to achieve $125-130B in annual revenues in Amazon Web Services next year, in my opinion, which, assuming a stable operating income margin of 38%, would calculate to operating income converging upon $50B annually (and likely more in the years that follow). Shares are not cheap, but I see a long-term revaluation case for Amazon, with operating income (margin) growth being the single biggest catalyst for the e-Commerce and Cloud company.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732319-the-middleby-corporation-organic-growth-in-the-cf-segment-continues-to-be-poor,4732319,The Middleby Corporation: Organic Growth In The CF Segment Continues To Be Poor,"Summary

 -  Middleby's 3Q24 earnings were disappointing, primarily due to poor organic growth in its largest segment, Commercial Foodservice.
 -  The persistent weakness in the consumer spending environment, coupled with high mortgage rates and rising food costs, is negatively impacting the restaurant industry and, consequently, Middleby's business.
 -  Given the ongoing challenges in the Commercial Foodservice segment and the lack of near-term catalysts for a significant improvement, my hold rating on Middleby is maintained.


Summary

Following my coverage on The Middleby Corporation (NASDAQ:MIDD) in Aug’24, which I upgraded from a sell to a neutral rating due to my view that the Commercial Foodservice [CF] segment may see growth acceleration that could potentially lead to upward revision in multiples, this post is to provide an update on my thoughts on the business and stock. I stay hold rated for MIDD as I do not see any signs of recovery in the CF segment. In fact, various macro indicators suggest that performance will remain poor for the foreseeable future. Hence, I think the valuation gap between MIDD and its peers will stay at this level for the near term.

Investment thesis

On 31st October, MIDD released its 3Q24 earnings, which were horrible as results missed consensus estimates across the board. Revenue saw $942.8 million vs. consensus estimate. Of $997.56 million, gross margin came in below by ~110bps (37.7% vs. 38.7%), EBITDA saw $212.9 million, missing the consensus estimate of $229.2 million, and adj net earnings missed by ~$8 million ($125 million vs. $133.2 million). Driving the disappointing performance was the poor organic growth in the CF segment, which is the MIDD largest revenue and profit segment—64% of 3Q24 revenue and 77% of segment adj EBITDA.
Despite this performance, management expectation is for MIDD to see sequential revenue growth and further acceleration in FY25. In my previous post, I laid out the potential recovery case for this segment, wherein I thought that the decline in inflation would drive the Feds to cut rates, and this should result in more restaurant openings given the lower cost of financing. Fast-forward today, the feds did cut rates, but apparently, there was no visible impact on restaurant operators’ willingness to open more restaurants. And we can infer this from the fact that ordering levels, which improved in 1H24, started to decline in 3Q24.


Looking ahead, my belief is that the CF segment will remain challenged for the foreseeable future, and there are various macro indicators that point to this. To start, the restaurant performance index remained <100 for the 10th straight month, which means the industry is still shrinking—i.e., the overall spending power (to reinvest) of restaurants is falling—and this directly impacts the demand for new equipment that MIDD provides. Forward indicators such as the expectations index (which is largely based on the current situation index) continue to point to a contracting industry, which paints an even more negative demand outlook for MIDD’s CF segment.
Ultimately, the industry is driven by consumers' willingness to spend on food away from-home, and this boils down to the consumer spending environment, which remains poor as suggested from the consumer confidence index, and I expect it to continue being poor until mortgage rates come down. Housing is the largest expenditure of an average household in the US, and the problem is, the mortgage rates remain sticky at >6% levels despite the Fed cutting rates. The fact that mortgage rates actually went up after the Fed cutting rate meant that homeowners could not refinance at a cheaper rate. In addition, food costs have accelerated in recent months, putting even more pressure on US consumers’ spending power.
Put together, the CF segment should remain under pressure as consumers remain cautious on spending, which leads to poor performance for restaurant operators and therefore leads to little willingness to open new restaurants. This ultimately leads to lesser demand for new kitchen equipment, which means poor volume growth performance for MIDD.
On the pricing side of things, MIDD is not going to implement price increases in January 2025, which, I think, is more of a “MIDD cannot afford to raise prices” vs. “MIDD don’t want to raise prices” because they have already raised prices significantly during COVID. As such, against this backdrop of poor demand, raising prices will simply further dampen demand. Combining this with the poor volume outlook, MIDD is very likely to see a lackluster FY25 performance, in my opinion.

Valuation



My view previously (full text quoted below) was that MIDD could see a strong revision in multiples relative to Illinois Tool Works (ITW) if it starts to print positive organic growth for its CF segment. Given that organic growth for the CF segment continues to disappoint and perform very poorly against ITW—CF posted -5% organic growth (year-to-date down 4%) vs. ITW that saw ~0.3% decline in 3Q24 (year-to-date organic growth is flat), I see little reason for MIDD to see an upgrade. Hence, while the relative multiple spread between the two is at an all-time low of ~0.56x (based on forward EBITDA multiple), I expect this gap to remain until MIDD reports a strong recovery in its CF segment’s organic growth.

Conclusion

In conclusion, my rating for MIDD is a hold rating as the poor performance of the CF segment persists, driven by weak organic growth and challenging macro conditions. Despite management’s expectations for a recovery, recent indicators suggest that the segment will remain under pressure in the near term. The absence of price increases and the ongoing weakness in the consumer spending environment further exacerbate the outlook. Hence, I believe the valuation gap between MIDD and its peer ITW will unlikely to narrow.

 -  The October jobs report was significantly weaker than the previous month.
 -  From a Federal Reserve (Fed) standpoint, the murkiness of the data suggests that the central bank should look through Friday’s jobs numbers and persist with their planned policy rate path.
 -  Total non-farm payrolls increased by 12,000 in October. This is well below consensus expectations, which had been calling for 100,000.

The October jobs report was significantly weaker than the previous month. Still, with the data likely heavily affected by hurricanes Helene and Milton, it is difficult to decipher the underlying state of the labor market.
From a Federal Reserve (Fed) standpoint, the murkiness of the data suggests that the central bank should look through Friday’s jobs numbers and persist with their planned policy rate path. A 25bps cut at both the November and December FOMC meetings is still on the cards.

Report details


Policy outlook

With the hurricanes taking a heavy toll on today’s jobs numbers, it is doubtful that Friday’s labor report will prompt a knee-jerk reaction from the Fed.
However, a closer examination of the numbers suggests that beneath all the noise and disruption is a softening labor market. The consensus forecast for a 100,000 increase in payrolls was already considering the hurricane effect, so the significant downside surprise potentially indicates underlying weakness.
The report reaffirms that the Fed must persist with a gradual easing cycle despite the surprisingly strong economic activity data in recent weeks. We continue to expect a 25bps cut in both November and December.

Next week marks the conclusion of one of the most hotly contested elections in history, leaving many investors scrambling to prepare for potential market turbulence and policy shifts.
Despite short-term volatility, historical trends reveal that equities have consistently posted strong gains by the end of a presidential term, underscoring the benefits of maintaining a long-term investment perspective. The drivers of market performance - economic growth, corporate earnings, and innovation - ultimately outshine the impact of political changes.
The stock market and presidencies
S&P 500 price returns on a log scale, 1933–2023

Source: Clearnomics, Principal Asset Management. Data as of December 31, 2023.
With both U.S. presidential candidates at a dead heat heading into next week's election, markets are bracing for a result that could lead to a wide range of policy outcomes depending on who takes the White House and how Congress is configured. Yet, it is notable that, since 1933, equities have almost always risen by double-digits by the end of a president's term, regardless of their party affiliation.
As well as tied opinion polls, markets are also contending with uncertainty around the timing of when the race may be called, and the potential for a disputed result. But while these factors may bring a spike in short-term volatility, they are often quickly eclipsed by the long-term gains created by business cycles.
It is worth remembering that, although markets dropped in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election and struggled to find direction in the days of uncertainty following the 2020 election, on both occasions markets then delivered four years of solid gains.
Ultimately, the historically above average returns since 2008 are likely more attributable to underlying economic trends and structural advantages of the U.S. economy than to the administrations of Obama, Trump, or Biden.
Investors should take caution. Those who allow their political opinions to cloud their investing decisions could miss out on the potential rewards that come with staying invested in the market over the long term.

 -  The CME’s Fedwatch tool shows a 99.4% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut next Thursday, November 7th, 2024.
 -  The expected Q3 ’24 S&P 500 EPS growth rate jumped from an expected +4.4% last week to a current +8.4% as of Friday, November 1.
 -  There’s a lot of chatter in financial media on the move in the 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields in the month of October ’24.


Above is the CME’s Fedwatch, cut-and-pasted on Friday morning after the October non-farm payroll report, showing a 99.4% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut next Thursday, November 7th, 2024.
The mega-cap tech earnings are mostly done, except Nvidia (NVDA), the core PCE and GDP were released this past week, the October non-farm payroll report was released this past week, and if all that couldn’t dissuade any movement in fed funds futures, nothing will.

This LSEG “This Week in Earnings” chart was always fascinating, and I never took the time to study it, but it’s essentially a “net income” chart for the S&P 500. What it shows is the influence of the mega-cap names on the S&P 500.
Note the spike this week as Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) reported.

Readers have seen the above table before. It shows the weekly change in “expected” S&P 500 EPS and revenue growth rates for the current quarter, as well as through early ’26.
Note the improvement this week in the expected Q3 ’24 S&P 500 EPS growth rate: it jumped from an expected +4.4% last week to a current +8.4% as of Friday, November 1.
The four sectors that have seen the sharpest growth improvement in growth rates since October 1 are:
Note how Communication Services expected EPS growth has doubled from +12.3% to +24.1%.
As of 10/31/24, and per Bespoke data, the XLF or the Financial Sector SPDR Fund was +26.77% YTD, almost 700 bps better than technology and only exceeded by Communication Services' +28.85% YTD return.

Summary/conclusion

There’s a lot of chatter in financial media on the move in the 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields in the month of October ’24, but almost no one talks about the impact of the inverted yield curve on the financial system. The Fed will likely do two more 25 bps fed funds rate cuts before the end of 2024.
On Thursday night, after the FOMC announcement, the midpoint of the “expected” fed funds range of 4.50% to 4.75% will be 4.625%. That will still likely leave the yield curve slightly inverted, with the 10-year yield likely below the fed funds rate, but by December ’24, investors will likely see a fed funds rate at 4.375%, so investors might not see a true normal slope to the yield curve until 2025.
The 10-2 spread (i.e. the 10-year Treasury yield minus the 2-year Treasury yield) has been positive since late August ’24 or about 8 weeks, and per my internal spreadsheet that 10-2 spread first turned negative, and has stayed negative since July 8, ’22.
Perhaps I’m overstating its importance, but I suspect the Fed wants the Treasury yield curve to return to a normal slope. With a full weekend of writing still ahead, the weekly S&P 500 earnings update is being kept short and sweet.
The technology sector (Apple and Microsoft), the consumer discretionary sector (Amazon and Tesla (TSLA)) and the communications sector (Alphabet and Meta (META)) mostly passed with flying colors this week in terms of earnings. Microsoft was a little light in guidance, about $1 billion for a fiscal Q2 ’25 quarter and is expected to generate $69 billion in revenue, but the software giant did lower numbers.
Friday night, 11/1/24, after the market close, it was announced that Nvidia (NVDA) would be joining the Dow 30, and that Intel (INTC) would be kicked out of the old world index.
Per one source, and it can’t be recalled, only about 2% of the world’s global investable assets is benchmarked against the Dow 30. Ryan Detrick, who is a solid technical analyst, whom I was reading when he was still at Schaeffer’s Investment Research out of Cincinnati, (now at Carson Group) always noted that being ejected from the Dow 30 was typically a good sign that all the bad news was probably in that stock.
Ryan would know better than I, but there is a history of Dow rejects performing quite well after being tossed out of the Dow 30.
None of this is a recommendation or advice, but only an opinion. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can and does involve the loss of principal, even for short periods of time. Information on this blog may or may not be updated, and if updated may not be done in a timely fashion.

 -  D&B delivered solid 3Q24 results, with organic revenue growth of 3.4% year-over-year.
 -  The continued strong demand for its MDM product, along with the launch of AI-powered solutions and new partnerships, should drive growth and margin expansion.
 -  Given the positive outlook for D&B, I reiterate my buy recommendation.


Investment action

I recommended a buy rating for Dun & Bradstreet Holdings (NYSE:DNB) when I wrote about it on 5th August, as I expected organic growth to recover back to the 5-7% range as the feds cut rates. Based on my current outlook and analysis, I recommend a buy rating. The path ahead for DNB to sustain mid-single-digit growth remains visible, especially with new products and partnerships announced. The potential buyout offer should also set a floor to the share price.

Review

DNB reported 3Q24 earnings yesterday with revenue coming in at $609.1 million, which was a 3.5% y/y increase on a reported basis. On an organic basis, revenue grew 3.4% y/y, whereby North America revenue grew 2.7% y/y (Finance & Risk (F&R) organic revenue grew 1.2% y/y; Sales & Marketing (S&M) organic revenue grew 4.5% y/y); and international revenue grew 5.1% y/y (F&R organic revenue grew 6.3% y/y; while S&M revenue grew 2.4%). Adj EBITDA margin expanded moderately by 60 bps y/y to 40.6%, beating the consensus estimate of 40.1% by 50 bps, largely driven by operating leverage. That said, EPS of $0.27 came in line with the consensus estimate of $0.27.
All in all, DNB did well for 3Q24, and the main metric I am tracking—organic growth—continues to trend nicely. To address some of the readers’ concern that DNB organic growth slowed in 3Q24 (from 4.3% in 2Q24 to 3.4% in 3Q24), I highlight that this was due to a timing issue (relating to the delivery of ratably recognized revenue in North America F&R) and not due to any demand loss. That said, management did call out that, because of this shift, organic growth will come in at the low end of the FY24 organic growth guidance (4.1-5.1%). What this tells us is that organic growth is going to accelerate from FY23 (4% organic growth).
From a qualitative perspective, it was noted that this 3.4% y/y organic growth was better than management’s expectations, and the underlying demand for the S&M Master Data Management [MDM] product remains healthy. Recall from my 4Q23 update:
As such, healthy adoption traction in MDM is a good indicator for clients potentially adopting DNB’s Gen AI, F&R, third-party risk, and supply chain management products in the future, especially in this increasingly complex and global trade environment. On this point, I think the path to monetization is well underway as DNB continues to roll out relevant AI products, such as the launch of Chat D&B (in North America). You can think of this product as a “copilot” that helps to summarize and retrieve information from DNB and customers’ combined data blocks for due diligence. In this initial launch phase, Chat D&B will be free to use, which makes sense as DNB needs to drive up adoption and give clients an opportunity to use it so that they know how valuable it is. Over the longer term, the plan is to monetize it through incremental fees or a step-up in pricing.
DNB has also earned itself another revenue source that should further push its organic growth to the mid-single-digit range. Recently, DNB has gone into partnerships with the London Stock Exchange Group [LSEG] and Intercontinental Exchange [ICE], where DNB will contribute data in exchange for revenue share.
Finally, note that 90% of DNB’s revenue is still growing at 6% (this is the midpoint of management’s 5-7% medium-term target) and that retention rates are still in a very healthy range (96%). As such, with the above, I think it is very likely that the business can sustain this level of growth for the foreseeable future.
One last thing to discuss is that potential buyout offered by prospective buyers. From the management’s perspective, their aim is to sell the entire company (if this turns into a potential sale) rather than a divestiture of a smaller asset. This should set some floor to DNB’s share price as the news of a potential buyer was announced on 2nd August when DNB traded at $11.82. Given the improvement in the business, where organic growth continues to trend at the mid-single-digits range, and that DNB is now past the investment period for its new software development (resources are freed up to invest in growth), which improves its FCF profile (~$15 million annualized capex reduction), I’d say the “floor” to DNB share price should be higher now since DNB can demand more value.

Valuation



Putting aside the potential for the buyout, I believe the stock has 18% upside over the next two years. Looking at how DNB has performed for 3Q24, the path towards DNB sustaining mid-single-digit organic growth seems a lot more plausible, especially with the healthy adoption of MDM, launch of AI products, and new partnerships. As such, I continue to model DNB achieving 6% organic growth by FY26. This should drive margin expansion due to operating leverage, where I remain conservative with my assumption that DNB will only recover margins back to FY22 levels. I then value DNB at 11x forward PE (based on FY26 earnings) to derive at a market cap of ~$6.2 billion or share price target of ~$14. The reason to use 11x is because it is where DNB trades today, and this is a fairly conservative multiple.

Risk

Digital marketing is still performing poorly, which is a drag on revenue growth. Given that this depends heavily on the health of the macro environment (businesses pull back on marketing budgets due to macro uncertainty), this could remain a drag on DNB’s North America S&M business, potentially causing it to miss its organic growth targets.

Final thoughts

My recommendation is still a buy rating for DNB. The business continues to see positive organic growth traction, and I believe it can continue to do so given the demand for its MDM product, new AI-powered solutions, and partnerships. The potential for a buyout adds another layer of upside, and at the same time sets a floor for the share price. As D&B continues to execute on its growth strategy, I believe it can sustain mid-single-digit organic growth.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732313-brinker-international-chilis-traffic-year-begins-on-a-high-note,4732313,Brinker International: Chili's Traffic Year Begins On A High Note,"Summary

 -  Success of 3-For-Me and Triple Dipper: Promotions such as 3-For-Me and Triple Dipper attracted young customers and boosted sales and traffic.
 -  Commitment to traffic growth: Chili's has achieved all traffic targets for three consecutive years, driven by value campaigns and a strategic menu.
 -  Valuation outlook: Brinker could grow by 2025; maintaining performance, the P/E projects appreciation, with the potential to reach PT of $110.


A commitment to traffic growth: promises kept

Everyone starts a new year hoping to achieve great things. We put all our goals on the table and draw up a detailed plan to achieve them, and by the end of the year we have only managed to achieve a few things from the list we made the previous year. Losing a little weight or learning to speak a new language can wait a little. That's just life. Now, imagine achieving all your goals for three years in a row! That's what Chili's (NYSE:EAT) did during its turnaround.
As I explained in my last analysis, throughout its turnaround process, Chili's established ""Obsession Metrics,"" defined at its Annual General Manager Conference. These metrics were established as a way to meet the vital needs for a consistent operation.
For FY 2023, the Obsession Metric was ""Manager Turnover."" In 2022, only 45% of restaurants were fully staffed for GM positions and only 15% for non-GM positions. According to data from Black Box Intelligence, we can clearly quantify the consequences of this on comparable sales. The most recent research showed that restaurants that are fully staffed for GM positions have 2.8% more traffic and 3.3% more comparable sales growth. While in the industry this situation softened in 2023 with 65% of companies becoming fully staffed for GM positions, this stagnated in 2024. Looking at Chili's they started to control this in 2022, paving the way for the next Obsession Metric that has a very close relationship with this one.
For FY 2024, the Obsession Metric defined was 'Hourly Turnover'. Now, controlling turnover in management positions makes it easier to do the same for other positions, both in the back of the house and in the front of the house. Typically, when the company is fully staffed with GMs, hourly turnover reduces by almost 17%. Of course, other benefits in traffic and comparable sales are unlocked for restaurants that reach this level. FSRs that are in the first quartile for lowest hourly turnover enjoy 5% more traffic than the last quartile for back-of-house employees and 7.1% for front-of-house employees.
Finally, in FY 2025, Chili's established 'Traffic Growth' as ​​its Obsession Metric. Now, it's been quite a journey to get here. I want you to notice that the previous Obsession Metrics were not just about controlling rising operating costs, but also about focusing all of their efforts on driving traffic. At the end of the day, both manager turnover and hourly turnover were intrinsically linked to dragging down comparable sales and traffic. It was a long but necessary journey.
Even before FY 2025, we were already seeing flat comparable sales. Even with quarterly traffic, Chili’s was managing to keep its comparable sales positive through strategic price increases, but after its Better Value Than Fast Food campaign and the launch of 3-For-Me in April, everything changed for the better. Riding the fast food exodus and picking up incremental traffic from guests who traded up, its barbell lever promotion was a huge hit from the start. Traffic grew by nearly 20% in the weeks leading up to the 3-For-Me launch, showing that the company’s value positioning was resonating with guests. The Big Smasher in particular was a big hit, as part of the low end of the barbell menu it drove a lot of incremental sales, both on and off the promotional menu.
From 3.5%, comparable sales surged to 14.8%. Traffic was now the biggest driver of comparable sales, not price increases, going from -1.8% in Q3 2024 to 5.9% in Q4 2024. And if you think the mix was hurt by 3-For-Me, you're wrong. Only 18% of guests were in the $10.99 range of the promotion, including 25% of Big Smasher orders coming in at full price. Within 3-For-Me itself, the $14.99 and $16.99 ranges account for almost 50% of orders, which is relatively rare, as promotional menus are usually responsible for attracting guests at their entry price point. That's a barbell job well done. Look at the average check growth, it grew from 5.3% to 8.9% after the launch of 3-For-Me.
Looking ahead to Q1 2025, we can see that Chili’s continued to show year-over-year traffic growth. These were very strong results that only reinforce my belief that FY 2025 will truly be the 'Year of Traffic' for Chili's. Comparable sales grew again in double digits, reaching 14.1% in the quarter. Of that, about 6.5% was traffic alone, accelerating once again from the previous quarter. To give you an idea, Chili's had to invest in additional labor in June at some locations to handle the increased traffic.
Looking at average check growth, we can see a slight decrease, not worrisome, but driven by a 1% increase in the '3-For-Me' mix, which may indicate that some of those Big Smashers that were sold at full price are now being sold within the value platform. This caused check growth to be 7.6%, slightly below the 8.9% we saw in Q4 2024, but still well above its peers.
Let's take a look at Chili's comparable sales, as well as their breakdown into traffic and average check crew growth, to give you some sense of what's going on:


Note that Chili's comparable sales growth is well above the benchmark FSR SSS Index and FSRs like Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) and Applebee's (DIN). Even when we look at Bubba's 33, a promising concept in Texas Roadhouse's (TXRH) portfolio that is growing its comparable sales in the mid-single digits, we see how strong Chili's comparable sales are.


Here I want you to notice the progress, especially in traffic, that Chili's has made year over year after its first two years of Obsession Metrics. Controlling turnover of both GMs and employees was one of the levers the company pulled, even before 3-For-Me. After the launch of the value platform, things changed and traffic grew by double digits. In Q1 2025, traffic accelerated again. This time it wasn't just from value promotions, but from the Triple Dipper, which went viral on social media and generated a lot of incremental sales, especially in the younger demographic.

Triple Dipper: Transforming the Core-4 into 5 to Drive

During a two-year simplification that reduced its menu by approximately 25%, Chili's established a set of items it calls the ""Core-4."" These are burgers, crispers, fajitas and margaritas. Together, they account for 47% of the casual dining chain's top-line sales, or approximately $535.33 million. In my latest analysis, I delved into each component of the ""Core-4,"" and I highly recommend reading it to understand how Chili's is doing such a great job on all of these fronts (except for fajitas, which should still stand out with their own platform in the future).
All that was good can get even better. Early in the quarter, we saw that in addition to the Big Smasher, the Triple Dipper also went viral on TikTok, bringing a horde of younger guests into Chili's. Impressively, the Triple Dipper now represents 11% of Chili's top-line sales in Q1 2025. That's about $125.29 billion! What's even funnier is that in the same quarter last year, the Triple Dipper generated $73.7 million in revenue for Chili's. That means sales grew by 70%. With mentions of the Triple Dipper starting to pick up steam in April and May, Chili's didn't wait long to introduce an LTO for the Dipper. This was the Nashville Hot Mozz Sticks and was introduced about a quarter after the initial success. It was so successful that it was soon made a permanent item.
With this significant sales mix, management decided to adopt it for the Core-4 family, transforming it into 5 to Drive. 5 to Drive now represents 58% of Chili's sales, or approximately $660.62 million. With the continued success of the Dipper, we expect to continue to see younger guests and traffic increase along with the check. I say this because management has confirmed that these guests have checks that are about 20% larger and have a higher frequency than guests from other demographics, as they rely on the different sauce and appetizer options. Increasing traffic from this demographic is like killing two birds with one stone, as the increased traffic will also lead to an increase in the average check per guest as the demographic mix increases. There are lots of opportunities to take advantage.

Looking ahead, what can we expect from Chili's?

In addition to expanding the Triple Dipper and perhaps rotating some dishes from the '3-For-Me' (not yet the Big Smasher, which despite its vitality is still one of the most successful options within the value platform), Chili's will continue to explore the barbell in alcoholic beverages. Even with the negative mix year over year, the company is taking advantage of the profitability of its slightly more expensive appetizer options and super premium options.
Now, while Chili's is doing a good job with the barbell in alcoholic beverages, other FSRs are having some trouble adjusting their alcoholic beverage offerings. This is the case of restaurants like Texas Roadhouse which saw a 20 basis point drop in negative mix in the third quarter and other concepts like Keke's (which expanded its alcohol service to more than 80% of its locations). Even Applebee's Dollarita, which is priced at a rock-bottom price compared to Chili's more affordable options like the ‘Marg of the Month’ that starts at $6, is underperforming when it comes to the alcohol mix.
As for the development pipeline, we could start to see some movement in the coming quarters. The new location in Leander, Texas is generating $160,000 in weekly sales and is still going strong for Q2. If it continues on this path, it will become one of Chili's highest-selling locations, with an AUV of over $8 million. But why do I think this is? Well, the CEO said that one option they are looking at right now would be to bring the pipeline back to new locations, but perhaps with some kind of lean prototype that would guarantee a high ROI and a short payback period. You know how much I love to talk about these types of locations, but unfortunately, he didn't give any more details about a possible prototype.
For Q2, management anticipated that comps would continue to grow year-over-year in double digits in October (likely close to what we saw in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025), in addition to positive traffic.

Is a buy still justifiable at these levels?

Recently, some investment banks have downgraded Brinker due to the price levels at which the stock is trading. Now, does this still justify a purchase? Well, as I said the first time, Brinker is certainly not a stock that you can buy at this time (and not even at my first analysis) with a comfortable margin of safety for some more conservative value investors. Anyway, let's take a look at the comps based on some data released by management for the entire FY 2025.
Now, assuming that FY 2025 EPS is between $5.20 and $5.50, we can take a look at the P/E. What other FSR restaurants are showing stellar performance and consistent traffic? Well, at Chili's level, I can only think of Texas Roadhouse, the big winner in the 'Battle of the Steakhouses'. Both are maintaining mid-single-digit traffic growth year over year supported by moderate growth in the average check. Texas Roadhouse is trading at a P/E of 30.42 and Brinker at 20.98. Now, we can assume that Brinker has the ability to reach at least Roadhouse's average P/E over the last 5 years (given the similarity of performance). In this case, considering the P/E of 27.35 and the low end of the EPS estimates, we have a price of approximately $142 and the high end of $150. We can also consider that Brinker reaches a P/E similar to Darden Restaurants' (DRI) five-year average of 21.26. In this case, the PT could range between $110 and $116.
We can also model based on expected revenue. Management tells us it could be $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion in FY 2025. That's roughly an RPS of $105.71 to $106.74. Now, if we assume a P/S of 1.75 (which is Roadhouse's 5-year average), we have a PT of over $180! No, I don't think we should go that extreme, but it could indicate that there is still some upside ahead. Well, the same thing happens when we look at Darden, both based on the 5-year average and what the stock is trading at today.
Now, it is quite likely that Brinker will continue to outperform most FSRs in FY 2025, and it is not unlikely that the valuation will stretch further and further as good news is heard. On top of that, we have our own Maggiano's 'Secret Thesis' that few are looking at. I believe that just as Texas Roadhouse itself plans to open more Bubba's 33 and Jaggers, Brinker has a bright future planned for the brand. We can discuss Maggiano's results in more depth in another article.
Therefore, I reiterate my 'Buy' rating for Brinker, with a PT of $110. But remember. This recommendation may not be for those investors who like a large margin of safety. At least keep an eye on Brinker, it may surprise you like it surprised me last year.

Introduction

The Dividend Champions list is a monthly compilation of companies which have consistently increased their annual dividend payouts. However, since this list is only produced once per month, the data in it can quickly get out of date.

In this weekly series, I highlight recent and upcoming dividend related activity for dividend stocks on the Dividend Champions list.
In the data presented below, Yield is forward annualized and Years reflects the up-to-date streak, including dividends declared since the last edition of the Dividend Champions list.

 -  Altria stock surged 7.83% after beating Q3 earnings expectations, with 1.3% net revenue growth and 7.8% adjusted EPS growth.
 -  The company has long-term growth potential through smoke-free products like NJOY and rewards shareholder via dividends and buybacks in the meantime.
 -  Altria announced a cost-saving initiative called ""Optimize & Accelerate,"" which is expected to save the company at least $600 million over the next five years.
 -  Legal disputes involving Juul and NJOY present a risk for Altria.
 -  Despite the risks, the stock is priced as if its free cash flow per share will fall over the next 10 years and never grow after that, which seems unlikely to me. Thus, I believe it's undervalued.


I recently wrote an Altria (NYSE:MO) article titled ""Altria Stock: Still Smoking Hot Despite Declining Sales."" I still think this is true, and the stock was hot today. MO finished 7.83% higher today after beating Q3 earnings expectations, and the company actually saw a slight increase in sales.
In the previous article, I also mentioned how it would be prudent to wait for a dip too before buying a large position, and the dip happened. Now, I feel the same. I think Altria stock is a good Buy for the long term due to improving per-share figures, its low valuation, and its growth potential from smoke-free products, so that's what I'm rating it as. Still, it would likely be prudent to wait for a dip again before buying in bulk. That's just my opinion.
Nonetheless, the stock remains undervalued, with negative FCF/share growth being priced in, and this time, I'll use reverse discounted cash flow analysis to prove it. There are also legal risks to consider, but I think the low valuation somewhat offsets these risks. Now, let's start off by going over its Q3 results.

A Quick Overview Of Altria's Q3 Results

In Q3, Altria reported revenue net of excise taxes of $5.34 billion, up 1.3% year-over-year, beating estimates by $10 million. Meanwhile, adjusted diluted EPS hit $1.38, up 7.8% year-over-year, beating the $1.35 estimate.
Shipment volume for NJOY (Altria's e-cigarette brand) consumables grew by 15.6% year-over-year to 10.4 million units. As a result, NJOY consumables retail market share in the U.S. multi-outlet and convenience channel increased from 3.4% to 6.2%. Further, NJOY devices shipment volume grew from 0.4 million to 1.1 million, nearly a 3x increase.
At the same time, its Smokeable Products division remained resilient, posting 1.2% revenue growth net of excise taxes. This is despite an adjusted cigarette decline rate of 11.5% in the Smokeables segment. Higher margins (adjusted OCI margins increased from 59.6% to 63.1% in the segment) and prices really do help offset volume declines.


Moving on, the Oral Tobacco Products segment grew its net revenues by 5.8% year-over-year to $695 million, although its adjusted OCI only grew 2% as its adjusted OCI margin dropped by 2.5 percentage points to 66.8%. The drop was due to ""higher SG&A costs, higher promotional investments and mix change."" In this segment, its total retail market share fell from 41.8% to 37.6%, although it's on, product continues to perform well, growing its market share from 6.9% to 8.9%.
Looking at the results as a whole, there are some strong points (NJOY growth, Smokeables revenue growth, EPS growth) and weak points (falling market share and margins in Oral Tobacco, cigarette volume decline greater than the total industry decline). But I'd still say the results were decent overall, as Altria managed to grow its net revenues and adjusted EPS while slowly diversifying out of Smokeables.

Outlook Reaffirmed

Altria reaffirmed its full-year guidance. It expects adjusted diluted EPS of $5.07-5.15, which suggests a growth rate of 2.5-4% compared to $4.95 last year. Although the growth rate is low, it's a good growth rate relative to the valuation, which I'll get to later.

Altria Continues To Reward Shareholders With Dividends And Buybacks

In the quarter, Altria bought back 13.5 million shares at an average price of $50.37. The total cost of doing this was $680 million. Its share count as of October 22 has come down to 1,694,812,982 compared to 1,706,224,328 shares outstanding in Q2 -- or a 0.67% decrease.
Buybacks were a bit more aggressive on a year-to-date basis, as the company ""repurchased 67.6 million shares at an average price of $45.68, for a total cost of $3.1 billion"" in the trailing nine months. The share count was 1,763,461,775 at the end of last year, meaning that it has been reduced by 3.89% year-to-date.
$310 million was left in the repurchase authorization as of the end of September, and the company expects to complete the program by the end of the year. I assume that Altria will start a new buyback program after that.
Regarding dividends, they remain at $1.02/share per quarter (the dividend was raised by 4.1% in August), and the company is targeting mid-single-digit annual dividend growth through 2028. This is pretty good when you consider that the dividend yield is 7.49% after the recent gains. If the dividend grows by 5% for the next four years and the share price remains the same, the yield will increase to ~9.1%.

Cost Savings Are On The Way

Altria plans to launch a multi-phase ""Optimize & Accelerate"" initiative. The goal here is to speed up and improve efficiency across the organization. This plan involves ""centralizing work, streamlining and standardizing processes, further using generative artificial intelligence and automation, and outsourcing certain transactional tasks,"" according to the company.
The company anticipates that the plan will help them save at least $600 million over the next five years. However, these cost savings exclude the ""estimated total pre-tax charges for these initial phases of approximately $100 million to $125 million."" Those charges will be treated as special charges and not included in adjusted EPS.
But they are real expenses, so in reality, Altria should save closer to $500 million in the next five years. This is still good, although it's worth noting that the cost savings won't be a huge needle mover when considering its net income of over $10 billion.

The Current Valuation Prices In Per-Share Declines

When calculating Altria's trailing-12-months' free cash flow, I got to a figure of $8.492 billion. Using the most recent share count of 1,694,812,982, that equates to FCF per share of approximately $5.01, and that's what I used for the reverse DCF valuation below. The valuation shows how much growth is required in FCF per share to justify Altria's current price.
Essentially, FCF per share would need to grow by negative 0.76% annually over the next 10 years and then grow at 0% in perpetuity. That gives you a fair value of $54.46. The table on the right hand size of the screenshot shows the different fair value calculations based on different 10-year FCF per share CAGRs.


For context, I calculated the discount rate of 8.72% using the CAPM formula and used a levered beta of 0.889, which I got from simplywall.st, in order to be consistent with my last article regarding the discount rate. And I don't actually believe Altria will see 0% FCF per share growth in perpetuity, but I put it there to show how conservative the market is valuing the stock right now.
Analysts expect about $8.3 billion in FCF next year and $8.51 billion in 2026, which doesn't quite match the consistent decline shown in the reverse DCF above. Additionally, you need to consider that per-share results will be better than nominal results due to buybacks.


All Altria needs to do is grow its FCF per share by 2.5% annually for the next 10 years, with no growth ever after that, and the fair value will jump to $68.63 (26% upside potential).
Based on its track record, along with buybacks and its growth potential outside of the Smokeables division, I think that growth rate is achievable, making the stock undervalued. You may have more confidence when looking at a chart of its FCF per share over the years, which has grown nicely.



Legal Battles: A Risk To Watch

Currently, Altria is dealing with legal battles regarding NJOY’s patents, particularly with Juul. This could result in import bans or expensive litigation outcomes.
Here's a quote from Altria's CEO from the Q3 earnings call:
He also said:
Basically, NJOY has made simple design changes that will help them navigate three out of the four patent claims. The company is also working on finding a way to avoid the fourth patent.
However, the risk is that, as the CEO put it, ""you never know how litigation would turn out."" The judge extended the deadline for the initial determination in the case to December 6, and the final determination will be in late December. Given that NJOY is a higher-growth area for the company, a legal battle that leads to import bans will undoubtedly hurt the company. Therefore, this is a risk worth considering before buying the stock.

The Bottom Line On MO Stock

As I said in my last article, Altria stock is attractive for the long term. It's a company that generates lots of free cash flow, pays a growing and juicy dividend, and also buys back shares, enhancing per-share results even as revenue growth is challenged.
The company can offset its decline in Smokeables volumes through NJOY and its Oral Tobacco segment, providing long-term stability. Additionally, the ""Optimize & Accelerate"" plan can help improve the financials that much more, albeit by a small amount.
However, it's important to monitor the legal disputes with Juul over NJOY’s patents, which can negatively impact NJOY's growth depending on the outcome.
Despite these risks, the stock’s valuation implies negative free cash flow per share growth, which, I think, is too pessimistic, making the stock undervalued. Waiting for a dip before taking a larger position might still be a good approach, but the long-term investment case for Altria appears solid.
I prefer to look for GARP (growth at a reasonable price) stocks but also look for opportunities everywhere else. I don't have a specified time horizon. I invest in a stock for as long as my thesis holds true, and I get out when the facts change. 
In addition, I've developed market-beating algorithms with Python that have helped me find attractive investment opportunities within my own portfolio, and I have been investing since 2016.
On top of that, I've worked at TipRanks as an analysis/news writer and even as an editor for a few years, which not only kept me on top of the market but also helped me understand what people are interested in reading. Further, as an editor, I learned to pay attention to detail and found that there's plenty of misinformation and ""fluff"" out there that needs to be corrected. Thus, my goal is to provide accurate and useful information to the best of my abilities.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732306-fltw-long-term-growth-prospect-intact-but-quite-expensive-now,4732306,"FLTW: Long-Term Growth Prospect Intact, But Quite Expensive Now","Summary

 -  FLTW has a high exposure to technology stocks.
 -  These technology stocks benefit from many technological megatrends such as AI, cloud computing, AR/VRs, Internet of Things, etc.
 -  The fund is trading at an expensive valuation relative to its historical valuation range.


Introduction

We last covered Franklin FTSE Taiwan ETF (NYSEARCA:FLTW) back in February 2020. At that time, we highlighted that many Taiwanese stocks would benefit from escalating U.S. and China tensions. However, it has been more than 4 years since was wrote the analysis, and the macroeconomic environment is now very different. It is time for us to analyze FLTW again and provide our insights and recommendations.

ETF Overview

FLTW has a portfolio of about 130 Taiwanese stocks. The fund tracks the performance of the FTSE Taiwan Capped Index and has an expense ratio of 0.19%. This ratio is not expensive especially since FLTW involves foreign investments. The fund has a good growth prospect thanks to its exposure to technology stocks that will benefit from strong demand for artificial intelligence semiconductor chips in the near-term. The fund will also benefit from other technological megatrends in the long run. However, FLTW's valuation is quite expensive. Therefore, we think investors may want to patiently wait on the sidelines.



Fund Analysis

FLTW has had a good run in this bull market
Let us first review how FLTW has performed in the past few years. Like many other equity funds, FLTW has reached its cyclical low in October 2022 due to rising inflation and global inventory correction. However, since reaching this cyclical low, FLTW has had a good run in the past two years. As can be seen from the chart below, FLTW delivered a superior price and total returns of 66.2% and 77.1% respectively. In contrast, the S&P 500 index has delivered slightly inferior price and total returns of 62.3% and 67.4% respectively.


A portfolio of mostly technology stocks
The primary reason behind FLTW’s impressive return in this bull market has to do with its exposure to technology sector. As can be seen from the chart below, technology sector currently represent nearly two-thirds of FLTW’s portfolio. FLTW’s portfolio include many well-know tech companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSM) and MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTTF).


FLTW’s exposure to technology stocks is beneficial, as this sector has clearly benefited from the demand for artificial intelligence hardware in the past 2 years. Looking forward, we expect FLTW’s stocks to continue to benefit from strong demand. High-profile companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Meta (META) have clearly indicated their willingness to continue to increase their capex on AI related investments. Therefore, FLTW should continue to do well in the near-term. In the long run, we expect FLTW’s technology stocks to also benefit from many other technological megatrends such as cloud computing, AR/VRs, Internet of Things, electrification of vehicles, industrial automation, etc.
Strong earnings growth in the next few years
Below is a chart that shows the consensus earnings growth forecasts for stocks included in MSCI Taiwan Index. Although this index is not the same as the FTSE index that FLTW tracks, there is significant overlap between the two. Their long-term performances are also very identical. Therefore, the chart below can also give us a good indication of what to expect through 2026. As the chart below shows, average earnings growth is expected to reach 38.7% in 2024. This growth rate is expected to decelerate (still very strong growth) to 18.0% and 14.3% in 2025 and 2026 respectively. In contrast, earnings growth rates for stocks in the S&P 500 index are expected to be 15.0% and 13.0% in 2025 and 2026 respectively.


Elevated valuation
Let us now look at FLTW’s valuation. As can be seen from the chart below, average forward P/E ratio for stocks in MSCI Taiwan index is currently about 16.9x. This is towards the high end of the valuation range in the past 30 years. Therefore, we think FLTW is expensive right now.


Risks to be considered
There are two risks that we think investors should keep in mind. The first risk is currency risk. Since FLTW invests in Taiwanese stocks, the strength of U.S. dollar relative to New Taiwan Dollar can impact FLTW’s fund price. A strong U.S. dollar means FLTW’s fund price may depreciate and vice versa.
The second risk investors need to keep in mind is supply and demand imbalance. At the moment, demand for artificial intelligence hardware is driving earnings growth for many technology stocks in FLTW’s portfolio. However, this demand can quickly reverse if companies such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, etc. scale back their capex. If this happens, technology stocks in FLTW's portfolio will be impacted negatively. Many Taiwanese companies may end up dealing with excessive inventories, such as the case back in late 2021 and 2022.

Investor Takeaway

In conclusion, we like FLTW’s growth prospect in the long run. However, its valuation is not cheap. We think having some margin of safety is important. Therefore, we think investors may want to wait for a pullback before initiating a position.

 -  Bladex results are in line with continued growth in assets and flat spreads. However, the bank has warned of increasing competition.
 -  The company is expecting to grow its fee-based revenues, to reduce exposure to spread and interest rate risk.
 -  The bank offers a yield of more than 15%, at the same time as it grows its loan book at mid-teens. This seems very attractive.
 -  Even assuming a return to very loose credit conditions like 2021, and no reduction in OpEx, the bank continues to offer a good 8% yield.


Bladex (NYSE:BLX) reported 3Q24 results this week, with the bank continuing to post loan book, NII, and fee growth, all leading to significant net income expansion.
Management gave information about the future, referring to plans to expand non-loan services, the potential effect of FED cuts on the bank's spread and ROE, and competition in Latin American capital markets.
The company continues to trade at very low TTM valuations, with a current price of $32 versus 3Q24 EPS of $1.44 (and 9M24 EPS of $4.2). The bank continues to trade below book value despite posting an ROE of 16%. These figures are very attractive but represent a positive period for BLX on a cyclical basis. Still, the bank is still attractive on a more average basis. I maintain the Buy rating.

3Q24 results

Loan and funding growth: Bladex has continued to expand its loan book by 5% QoQ and 17% YoY, approximately in line with the expansion seen in Q2 at 13% YoY. Funding grew approximately in line at 13% YoY, but with deposits continuing to make a bigger portion of the company's funding (59% vs 50% in 3Q23 and 58% in 2Q24).
Flat spreads and competition: The bank's net spreads have been about flat at 1.8% since 2022, with 3Q24 coming at 1.78%. The company's NIM has not improved much, with a few bps YoY and QoQ, based on more use of cash in loans. Management commented two times that competition is getting harder in the Latin American markets. With more capital available, some central banks are reducing their interest rates and liquidity in general. This could affect the company's spread and margins going forward.
NII and fee growth: Flat margins and loan growth imply net interest income growth of 10% YoY. If margins were slightly up and loan assets were up 17%, then NII should have grown more, but NII is probably reflective of assets as of 2Q24 (up 12% vs 2Q23).
On the other hand, fees were down YoY, about 6% or $600 thousand, and down QoQ, about $2 million or 15%. However, in both cases, the recurring letters of credit business grew, with structured loan commissions going down steeply. The structured loan business, more akin to investment banking deal flow, is more volatile.
The company's efficiency ratio went down 60bps YoY, despite the asset growth, and the implementation of technology platforms for increasing non-loan volumes (more below).

Business updates

Focusing on non-loans: In my last post, I commented on the company's goal to expand the credit letter and off-balance-sheet business (called off-balance sheet because the company has a commitment that is so remote it is not written on the balance sheet as a liability and therefore absorbs no capital). The focus on this area is to grow fee income from 13% of revenues to 18% by 2026 and reduce the bank's natural correlation with interest rates and credit spreads. The bank says its project to install an electronic credit letter issuing infrastructure is 30% complete and should be ready by 2H25.
Expanding to non-USD loans and derivatives: A small comment during the call was that the bank had started offering loans in local currencies, and derivatives contracts. Supposedly, these loans will be hedged to offset the FX exposure. The company's financial statements do not show a particular jump in derivative assets or liabilities, and there is no mention of FX exposure or loan exposure in other currencies, meaning this segment is very small.
FED effect on spreads and ROE: Management also commented that according to their models, each 100bps FED rate decrease impacts the company's interest margins by 12bps and into 100bps of ROE impact. The FED's latest dot-plot implies a decrease of FED rates by 100bps per year (4% by 2025, 3% by 2026), so BLX will need to offset those effects.
The impact on margins comes from two sources. First, the equity of the bank yields less if rates are lower, reducing the margin (but no the spread). Second, in a context of lower rates, there is more liquidity and more competition for business, lowering the bank's spreads.

Valuation

Price has not moved: Since my last article from July 2024, BLX's stock is down 1.65%, so basically flat.
No change to the thesis: My valuation of the name has not changed, as there have not been any fundamental changes to the business. Back in July, the FED rate cuts were already on the table, as well as potentially more liquidity impacting the company's spreads.
Current yield is very attractive: With loan and income growth, the bank's EPS has become very attractive. On a TTM basis, BLX generated EPS of $5.47 as of 3Q24, or a P/E ratio of less than 6x. Similarly, the bank's TTM ROE was 16.4% in 3Q24, but the stock trades at a P/B of 0.9x.
The problem, of course, is what would happen if the company's business deteriorated.
Reduction in rates: From the above comments from management, if we assume a 100bps reduction per year in FED rates generates a 100bps reduction in ROE (ceteris paribus), we could expect $13 million in net income loss per year (current equity is $1.3 billion). This would not meaningfully move the needle (3Q24 net income above $150 million).
Worse case scenario: The company's spreads could decrease substantially because of increased credit availability. For example, the bank's spreads averaged 1.15%. In addition, with FED rates on the floor in 2021, the company's margins reached 1.3% (see FY21 presentation).
In that context, on the same asset base ($11.4 billion), the company would generate $150 million in NII (versus $255 million TTM). Further, assuming a reduction in fees to $20 million from the current $40 million TTM (based on more competition on fees as well) and flat OpEX of $77 million, we could be talking of $93 million in net income (Bladex pays no income taxes in Panama), or a yield of 8% on its current market cap ($1.17 billion).

Conclusions

Bladex has several quality characteristics that I have commented on in all of my articles on the bank since I started a Buy rating in 2021 (100% return since).
The bank seems undervalued from a current income perspective, but the current positive cycle may indeed revert. Still, even assuming some of the worst business conditions (liquidity and low rates of 2021, halving of fees, and no reduction in OpEx), the bank would still offer a yield of 8%.
I do not know where liquidity conditions are going, but it seems unlikely that we will return to 2021 conditions. Even under that scenario, the yield is not bad.
Because of that, I believe Bladex continues to be an opportunity, and maintain my Buy rating.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732304-honeywell-why-i-am-buying-the-drop,4732304,Honeywell: Why I Am Buying The Drop,"Summary

 -  Honeywell reported better-than-expected profits in Q3 2024 but reduced its full-year sales and profit forecast due to cost pressures and weaker performance in Industrial Automation.
 -  Aerospace Technologies and Building Automation segments showed strong double-digit sales growth, helping to offset a 5% sales decline in Industrial Automation.
 -  Despite the sell-off, Honeywell remains appealing for passive income investors with a reliable 2% dividend yield and a lower valuation, especially with potential for long-term dividend growth.


The stock price of industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) crashed after the presentation of 3Q24 earnings as the company’s outlook was lowered and the Industrial Automation segment disappointed.
Honeywell International, however, is still enjoying modest sales growth and managed to report a healthy profit for the third quarter.
In my view, the sell off for Honeywell International’s stock has gone too far and Honeywell International’s low profit-based valuation multiple creates a solid margin of safety for passive income investors.

My Rating History

My last stock classification on Honeywell International was Strong Buy primarily because of momentum in the Aerospace business. The industrial company lowered its full-year sales and profit forecast for 2024 amid cost pressures, however, which caused the stock to sell off.
I think that Honeywell International’s business is actually doing quite well, with the exception of Industrial Automation, and despite the lowered forecast, I think the stock presents earnings and dividend value for investors.

Honeywell International Beats Profit Estimates But Lowers Forecast For 2024

Honeywell International reported third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.58 per share which allowed the company to sail past consensus profit expectations of $2.52 per share. It was the third consecutive profit beat for Honeywell International in 2024.


The earnings report of Honeywell International came on the heels of the one presented by GE Aerospace (GE) two days earlier. GE Aerospace beat expectations as well and profited from robust demand in its core engine business.
Honeywell International’s Aerospace Technologies and Building Automation did quite well and managed to meet high expectations, with both segments producing double-digit sales growth on a YoY basis.
Aerospace Technologies, which profited just like GE Aerospace from strong order volumes for aircraft engines and avionics, reported a 12% YoY jump in segment sales and a similar increase in segment profits.
Building Automation gained 14% higher sales primarily because of Honeywell International’s acquisition of Global Access Solutions, which was for the first time fully reflected in the conglomerate’s financials. Global Access Solutions was acquired by Honeywell International from Carrier Global Corporation's (CARR) for $5.0 billion to strengthen its automation business.
Robust performance in Aerospace Technologies and Building Automation was offset by a sales contraction in Industrial Automation, where net sales declined 5% compared to the quarter a year ago. All segments considered, Honeywell International produced net sales of $9.7 billion, up 6% YoY (3% organic).



Honeywell International Updated Its Sales And Profit Guidance

The industrial conglomerate updated its full-year sales margin and profit forecast amid persistent cost inflation, but the long-term forecast for growth, in terms of profit margin growth, is intact.
As per the latest update, Honeywell International anticipates $38.6-38.8 billion in sales, which reflects back to us 3-4% sales growth on an organic basis compared to 5-6% previously.
The company lowered its forecast due to what management called a delay in a growth rebound in some of its businesses, like Industrial Automation. Weaker-than-expected growth is the main reason for Honeywell International’s revised guidance and drove the stock price correction after earnings.
Profits are anticipated to fall into a range of $10.15-10.25 per share, reflecting 7-8% growth YoY (compared to 6-8%, based on prior guidance).


Though Honeywell International has lowered its forecast for sales, the company is well on track to achieve its long-term financial goals of 4-7% organic sales growth.
I think that cost inflation is an issue that deserves caution, but at the end of the day, the industrial conglomerate lowered its organic sales growth forecast only by 2 percentage points while raising its profit growth outlook by 1 percentage point.
As a matter of fact, Honeywell International’s 2024 guidance is, at the high-end of the forecast, equal to the low-end of its long-term forecast. With Aerospace in particular doing great, I anticipate Honeywell International will be able to meet its long-term financial targets in 2024.


As far as the outlook is concerned, the aviation market is still in a pretty good constitution and airlines are investing a lot of money to upgrade to more fuel-efficient aircraft. This in turn should boost engine demand, which would benefit big engine manufacturers like Honeywell.
Since Aerospace is the biggest segment for Honeywell International in terms of sales share of 40%, a robust order backdrop is likely going to determine the overall direction of the conglomerate’s total sales trend.
In addition, the labor market is in great shape as well, pointing to a strong U.S. economy: ADP just released its private payroll data for October, which showed that employers created 233K jobs. The jobs number beat the consensus of 113K new jobs. A robust economy with strong job gains, receding inflation and a return to growth in the aviation market after the Covid pandemic could support the investment thesis for Honeywell International also.


One of the most compelling features of an investment in Honeywell International is that the industrial conglomerate has grown its dividend reliably for a long time. Thus, Honeywell International is primarily a dividend investment that has a reasonable chance of growing its pay-out moving forward, notwithstanding a short-term disappointing sales outlook.
Based on a stock price of $206 and a dividend per share of $4.32, Honeywell International yields 2%. This may not seem like much, but over time, the industrial conglomerate has raised its dividend quite reliably.



Technical Chart Profile

The stock of Honeywell International crashed through the 20-day and 50-day moving average trendlines, which are short-term sentiment indicators, after the industrial conglomerate reported 3Q24 earnings. The sales forecast in particular was perceived as soft, leading to selling pressure.
In the short-term, Honeywell International is at risk of dropping back to the 200-day moving average trendline, a break of which would likely represent more correction potential down to the $190 region where HON is built some support in the past.



Honeywell International Is Too Cheap To Ignore

Honeywell International is rather cheap following last week’s sell-off. The market models $11.11 per share in profits for next year, reflecting back to us an about 9% anticipated YoY profit jump.
The profit estimate seems moderate to me and could potentially be viewed as conservative. I think that if Aerospace continues to perform as well as it did so far in 2024, Honeywell International could actually see positive profit estimate corrections in 2025.
With a present stock price of $206.10, Honeywell International is selling for a leading profit multiple of 18.5x.


GE Aerospace is anticipated to produce profits of $5.24 per share in 2024, reflecting 21% YoY growth, so profits are expected to grow about twice as fast as they are in the case of Honeywell International.
This, in my view, is due to the fact that GE Aerospace is focused exclusively on the aviation market, which is presently crushing it, whereas Honeywell International is a bit more diversified along industrial segments. The implied profit multiple for GE Aerospace here is 30.6x.



Why The Investment Thesis Might Be Misguided

Honeywell International offers more diversification potential than GE Aerospace since the conglomerate is also focused on industrial, energy and automation products. This in turn limits both Honeywell International’s upside and downside, relative to more focused businesses like GE Aerospace.
Honeywell International’s forecast for 2024, which was revised lower, is a potential risk, as is cost inflation, which could lead to the conglomerate missing its forecast for 2024.

My Conclusion

I think investors have turned too pessimistic on Honeywell International after the industrial conglomerate disappointed with its earnings release for 3Q24.
The conglomerate is still doing rather well from a profit growth angle and the change in the 2024 forecast is not significant enough to justify last week’s correction, in my view. The technical picture is also quite compelling, though short-term pressure has pushed the stock back to the 50-day moving average trendline.
I think that the key value proposition for Honeywell International is consistent dividend growth in the future and since the stock is now more affordable as well, I am turning out to be a buyer here and scoop up more shares on the drop.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732301-turnaround-of-lincoln-national-corporation-ongoing,4732301,Turnaround Of Lincoln National Corporation Ongoing,"Summary

 -  Lincoln National Corporation is in the midst of a turnaround, recovering from significant setbacks in 2022, particularly in its Life insurance segment.
 -  The company has made strategic changes, including emphasizing Group Protection products and rethinking reinsurance, leading to improved financial metrics.
 -  With this progress, tangible book value per share in Q3 ascended past the current stock price.
 -  With this slight discount and steady improvements already taking effect, LNC makes for an easy, clear-cut Buy.


Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) is a company in the middle of a turnaround. Over the last few years, the stock fell significantly from its all-time highs.


After making some fundamental changes, a gradual recovery has followed. After looking at the progress so far and the newly released third quarter results, I concluded the company has reached important milestones in its transformation, but more remains to be done. Q3 results have created a discount to the balance sheet, so I've ultimately come away viewing LNC as a Buy until the gap closes.

The Problems

For most of the past decade, Lincoln was on a path of general growth, both in revenue and in earnings. Effects of COVID notwithstanding, 2022 posed a decisive reversal of these trends.


Lincoln deals in life insurance and workplace benefits. The setback was primarily driven by the Life business. The biggest hit was a $1.8 billion balance sheet loss, which then-CFO Randy Freitag explained in the Q3 2023 earnings call:
In short, better data and post-pandemic behaviors indicated that lapses on the Life products would be much lower than expected, creating a larger, long-term liability and pushing Lincoln into unhealthy capital ratios. This forced them to hurry into establishing reserves for this larger liability.


In order to stabilize and maintain liquidity, share repurchases declined and halted entirely in 2023.


Similarly, they stopped increasing their dividend and focused on maintaining current levels.


Illustrating the impact that these moves had on tangible book value, we see a sharp drop between 2022 and 2023.

Turning It Around

In the near-two years that followed, Lincoln began work to transform the business and get it into segments with lower risk and better upside potential.


Toward the end of 2023, management had decided on greater emphasis of the Group Protection segment. These products include disability, accident, vision, dental, and similar types of policies.


They also considered completely rethinking their reinsurance strategy, along with potentially selling off non-core businesses.


Coming into 2024, sales in the Life products were slowed down in order to address the previous risks.


With these changes in place, Lincoln began to post improved numbers, with its risk-based capital ratio returning to well over 400% (where it had been prior to 2022). Similarly, leverage ratio has fallen below 30%.


Additionally, the company is delivering on its improvements in the Group Protection segment, with margins up and loss ratios on its policies declining.
While management continues to guide for further improvements, I believe these signs show that the turnaround is underway and successful so far.

Valuation

With a financial, I typically prefer to look to tangible book value per share to value a business.


TBV per share was well over $100 at its peak. Naturally, I don't think Lincoln is under any obligation to return to those levels, particularly as those were based on misguided assumptions about the inherent risks of their Life products. While stabilizing the balance sheet has about doubled the value from its lowest point, the upper limits remain unclear, particularly as management has guided to return to buybacks once more progress is made. Buybacks would have a shrinking effect on TBV per share unless done at a discount.
With Q3 results out, there is a slight discount to its TBV per share and additional upside requires us to imagine that Lincoln will continue to grow the balance sheet and not weaken it with buybacks at or above TBV per share.
For my part, and given the recency of the troubles and the ongoing nature of the turnaround, I would want to see more of a discount to TBV than is currently priced on the market.


That said, I am not terribly worried about Lincoln. Ranked at #6, they are a leading insurer, and the broader market remains highly fragmented. There is opportunity for deeper penetration that will allow for TBV to grow over time. The question, of course, is how they do that, knowing full well that lapses will be lower. As CEO Ellen Cooper explained during Q2 earnings:
So it's possible, but it doesn't sound easy.
With TBV per share over $40, we at least get a modest discount in spite of the challenges.

Future Outlook

While Q3 results are fresh off the presses, these are the new details that I would keep in mind as more quarters come out
Each of these things can directly impact the valuation, both in terms of the current TBV and the growth assumptions we can make going forward. Divestitures in particular would be telling of what they consider to be a low-ROE business and lower TBV per share.

Conclusion

Lincoln National Corporation seems to be through the worst of its setbacks in 2022. Still, the company is going through evolution and improvement. This could mean that additional upside exists for growth of TBV, and the current price gives a discount for the current value.
For these reasons, I think LNC makes a reasonable Buy.

 -  Bloom experienced double-digit revenue growth since its 2018 IPO but remains unprofitable. To be profitable, it has to grow revenue beyond its breakeven level and improve efficiency.
 -  Bloom has expanded its total addressable market with its expansion into the hydrogen business. But it needs reinvestment to grow and may need fresh capital.
 -  Despite optimistic projections for revenue growth and efficiency improvements, there is no margin of safety. Together with concerns about its financial position, this is not an investment opportunity.


Investment Thesis

Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE) is in the growth phase of its lifecycle. As such, despite double-digit revenue growth since its 2018 IPO, it is still not profitable. To be profitable, it has to grow revenue beyond its breakeven level and improve its efficiency.
If it can achieve this within a year or so, it may avoid having to raise additional capital. Nevertheless, even if this capital plan is achieved and assuming optimistic growth rates and improving efficiency, there is no margin of safety at the current market price.

Background

Bloom IPOed in 2018 as a clean/renewable energy company with its solid oxide fuel cells that convert natural gas or biogas into electricity. In 2020, the company announced its “intention to enter the commercial hydrogen market by introducing hydrogen-powered fuel cells and electrolyzers that produce renewable hydrogen.""
However, the main revenue source as of 2023 was still from the power generation business.
“To date, nearly all of our revenue has been attributable to sales of our power generating Energy Server.” 2023 Form 10k.
The company has yet to provide any revenue breakdown by country. However, according to the company 2023 Form 10k,
“The U.S. is currently our largest market in terms of revenue and installed base of the Energy Servers…Our second-largest market in terms of revenue and installed base of the Energy Servers is South Korea.”
The clean/renewable energy market is an evolving one, and I would classify Bloom’s current focus as follows:
The global demand for renewal energy is a high-growth one as illustrated by the following market research reports.
“The global renewable energy market size was estimated at USD 1.21 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.2% from 2024 to 2030.” Grand View Research.
“The global renewable energy market size was valued at USD 1085.0 billion in 2024…exhibiting a CAGR of 9.47% during the forecast period (2025-2033).” Straits Research.


The challenge for Bloom is that biogas technology is a small niche in the renewable electric power generation market. As can be seen from Chart 1, solar power (PV) and wind power alternatives are currently the leading technologies.
The positive point is that since its IPO, the company has increased its total addressable market by expanding into the hydrogen business. This is a sizable market with reasonable growth rates as illustrated by the following.
“The global hydrogen market was estimated to be worth USD 242.7 billion…growing at a CAGR of 7.8 % from 2023 to 2030” Markets & Markets.
“The Hydrogen Market industry is projected to grow from USD 287.49 billion in 2023...exhibiting a CAGR of 8.47% during the forecast period (2024 - 2030).” Market Research Future
Bloom currently generates its revenue from 4 sources – product sales, installation, maintenance service, and sales of electricity. But as can be seen from the left part of Chart 2, product sales are becoming a big part of the revenue while the contribution from the sales of electricity is becoming smaller.
In this sense, this is a good sign as the gross profit margins from the electricity sales have been declining over the past few years. At the same time, the gross profit margin for products has turned positive in 2018 with some improving trend.
I would suspect that the overall revenue and gross profit margin profile would change with the expansion into the hydrogen market.


Note to Chart 2: I did not show the 2023 gross profit margin for electricity as it was very negative and would have made it difficult to see the trends for the other revenue sources. The negative margin was due to the asset write-down related to the power purchase agreements.

Operating trends

The performance of Bloom from a profitability perspective is nothing to shout about. While it has been able to deliver revenue growth since its IPO, the company has not been profitable since 2014.
Since its IPO, revenue has been growing at a 16% CAGR. According to its 2023 Form 10k, revenue growth has been “… at a 30% compound annual growth rate over the last decade.”
Revenue growth with losses is typical of companies in the growth phase. The positive sign is that the losses have been reducing. Refer to the left part of Chart 3. Note that the additional losses after tax in 2019, 2022, and 2023 were due to asset write-downs for the electricity sales operations. Without these, as illustrated by the PBT before unusual items, there were improving trends (smaller losses).
Given the losses, you should not be surprised to see that the ROIC and ROE have been negative since 2015. Note that in the right part of Chart 3, there were some years with positive ROE. This is an “arithmetic” issue as the losses for the year were divided by negative equity.


Bloom is operating at a loss because it is operating below its breakeven level. This is illustrated in Chart 4. I estimated that to break even in 2023, its revenue would have to be 22% larger.
There are of course other ways to break even.
But unless Bloom has pricing power, margin improvements or fixed cost reduction has to come from improving efficiencies.


Note to Op Profit Profile. I broke down the operating profits into fixed costs and variable costs.

Efficiencies

To assess whether Bloom can improve its efficiencies, I looked at several operating and capital efficiencies. There are some positive signs.
To check whether these efficiency improvements are broad-based, I considered the following:
Given these findings, Bloom would find it challenging to improve operating or capital efficiencies without revenue growth. The good news is that there is a good track record of revenue growth.



Peer comparison

I compared Bloom with several publicly listed companies involved in the solid oxide fuel cell technology as shown in Table 1.
You can see that Bloom is among the smaller ones in the peer group in terms of revenue. However, it delivered the best growth from 2015 to 2023. Compared to Aisin and Siemens, which I would consider as mature companies, Bloom is still at the growth stage.


I compared the peer performance based on 4 metrics, as shown in Charts 6 and 7. In the charts, the top 2 performers (represented by the best metrics as well as “stable” trends) are of course, Aisin and Siemens.
But you can see that since 2015, Bloom's performance has been trending up towards the top 2 performers levels.



Funding growth

Growth needs to be funded and one way to assess this is the Reinvestment margin, defined as Reinvestment/Revenue.
Reinvestment = CAPEX + Acquisitions – Depreciation & Amortization + increase in Net Working Capital.
From 2015 to 2023, Bloom had an average Reinvestment margin of 11%. To give you a sense of the scale, the peer Reinvestment margin for the same period was:
Both of these peers are more established and are much larger than Bloom in terms of revenue. The higher Reinvestment margin for Bloom is probably because it is still at the growth stage compared to its more mature peers.

Financial position

I have concerns about Bloom's financial position.


Given that it is still operating below its breakeven level, Bloom needs revenue growth. This in turn required Reinvestments. I suspect that until it can reach a stage where there is positive cash flow from operations, it will have to rely on more debt and additional capital to fund its growth.
I use the Revenue/Invested capital as one metric to assess the funding requirements. From 2018 to 2023, the ratio was 1.0 for Bloom.
Even if you assumed that Bloom maintains its ratio, this meant that to double its revenue, it would need to double its invested capital. Without any positive cash flow from operations, this has to come from either debt or capital or some combination of them.
To give you a sense of the scale, over the same period, Aisin and Siemens had an average of 1.8 and 0.9 respectively for this ratio.

Valuation

I adopted the following picture in valuing Bloom.
The company will continue to grow at 20% CAGR for the next 5 years before becoming a mature company with a 4% perpetual growth rate. This is not an unreasonable growth rate as it achieved such a rate in 2021 and 2022. Bloom also has a bigger addressable market moving forward given its expansion into the hydrogen sector.
The company would be able to improve its operating and capital efficiencies such that:
I also assumed that there would be enough tax credit from its accumulated losses so that there is effectively no tax payable until the terminal stage.
I took a very optimistic picture that there would not be any additional share issuance. This is on the basis that the company would almost reach the breakeven revenue in Year 1 with positive cash flow from operations thereafter.
On such a basis, I obtained an intrinsic value of USD 9.19 per share compared to its market price of USD 10.14 per share (29 Oct 2024). There is no margin of safety.

Valuation model

I used a multi-stage Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) model where the FCFF and EBIT were determined based on the following:
FCFF = EBIT(1 – t) - Reinvestment.
EBIT = Revenue X contribution margin – Fixed cost. This was based on the operating model as shown in Chart 4.
The reinvestment rate was derived from the Reinvestment margin.
Value of firm = FCFF X (1+g) / (WACC – g).
Value of equity = Value of firm + cash + Other investments – Debt – Minority interests + excess Total capital employed.
Table 3 illustrates the calculation.


Notes to Table 3:
a) Straight line reduction equal to CAGR of 17.2%.
b) Pegged to growth rate.
c) Assumed proportionate improvement.
d) Assumed growth at 4%.
e) Assumed zero tax rate during growth period due to accumulated tax credits. Nominal 21% tax rate at terminal stage.
f) Assumed proportionate improvement.
g) b X f.
h) FCFF for each year = e - g
j) The WACC was determined from the first page results of a Google search for “Bloom Energy WACC” as illustrated in Table 4.
k) NPV for each year = (h X j)
l) Terminal for the year discounted at terminal growth rate
m) 5 years NPV + terminal value.
n) Inclusive of any excess TCE. Non-operating assets, MI and Debt
o) Based on the current number of shares.



Risks and limitations

My intrinsic value is based on an optimistic picture due to the following 2 key assumptions:
I have assumed that there is no additional capital call as the company would break even next year and generate positive cash flow from operations in Year 2.
My point is that there is no margin of safety assuming no fresh capital call. If there was an additional capital call, the number of shares would increase thereby reducing the intrinsic value per share.
Next, without the efficiency improvements especially on the Reinvestment margin, there would not be positive intrinsic value. The negative intrinsic value arose because the value of the firm was much smaller than the debt.
In my analysis, I have shown that the signs of efficiency improvements are not so clear-cut. As such you can understand why I see my valuation as an optimistic one.

Q3 2024 Outlook

I am a long-term value investor holding on to companies for 6 to 8 years. As such my focus is on annual trends. I generally consider quarterly results as ""noisy"".
However, in the case of Bloom, given that it is at the growth phase, the coming Q3 2024 results can provide some tell-tale signs of its growth picture. This is especially with regards to whether my 5-years high-growth phase and improvements in the efficiencies are realistic.
The company had given a USD 1.4 billion to USD 1.6 billion revenue guidance in its Q2 2024 presentation. I do not expect any revision upwards. But a revision downwards would mean that it is more overpriced that I estimated.
In this context, I would also be looking at whether Bloom would provide a breakdown of its revenue into the Energy Servers' segment and the electrolyzers' segment. I believe that the absence of any breakdown meant that significant contribution from the electrolysers' segment is still a few years away. I am sure that if the contribution is significant, the company would not miss the opportunity to shout about it.
Secondly, I would also be looking for signs of improvements in the Reinvestment margin. At this stage, I do not expect a positive cash flow from operations. But a reduction in this metric would be a good sign. The ideal would be a significant in reduction in the Net Working Capital and CAPEX.
And of course, any improvement in the gross profit margin would be good news.

Conclusion

Bloom is at the growth phase of its life cycle. As such, you should not be surprised to find that it is not profitable and has a high Reinvestment margin. But as revenue grows and the company matures, the losses should turn to profits and the Reinvestment margin should come down to a more sustainable level.
The positive point is that revenue has been growing since its IPO in 2018 and is currently not too far from its breakeven level. At the same time, Bloom has found a way to increase its total addressable market, providing it with a bigger growth runway.
It is then a question of Bloom continuing to build up its market share and improving its efficiency. While I am confident about its ability to grow revenue, I have some concerns about how much it could improve the operating efficiency.
But the other bigger challenge is ensuring that it has adequate capital (both from debt and equity) to fund its growth. I am more inclined to think that it probably will have to have another round of raising its equity.
But even assuming that it need not have to do this, and based on optimistic operating performances, my valuation shows that there is no margin of safety at the current market price. I would not go in at the current market price.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732297-mobs-office-but-no-need-for-life-support,4732297,"MOBs, Office But No Need For Life Support","Summary

 -  Unlike in traditional office, healthcare requires in-office interactions, which reduces the risk of ‘work from home’.
 -  Outpatient services are taking market share from inpatient (hospital) settings due to better costs and, in some cases, outcomes.
 -  America's rapidly aging population is a tailwind for all healthcare real estate.


No area of real estate has been under more pressure than the office sector. We won’t belabor the headwinds – flexible work, tech downsizing, debt maturities, etc. – in today’s report, but there is a niche section of office space benefiting from robust demand drivers. Historically, we referred to this group as Medical Office Buildings (MOBs); however, the higher quality end of the group has rebranded to Medical Outpatient Buildings (also MOBs) and we think the distinction is important. We break down the specifics further in this report, but there are three high-level factors driving the investment case for MOBs: 1) unlike in traditional office, healthcare requires in-office interactions which reduces the risk of ‘work from home’, 2) outpatient services are taking market share from inpatient (hospital) settings due to better costs and, in some cases, outcomes, and 3) the rapidly ageing U.S. population.
Point number three has implications across all of the healthcare, so it should not come as a surprise we have added exposure to healthcare REITs, representing one of our composite’s biggest overweights at 20.8% versus our benchmark, the MSCI US REIT Index (RMZ), at 13.9% as of October 31, 2024 (Figure 1). This wasn’t always the case, as we had zero healthcare exposure going into the pandemic and only modest positions beginning in mid-2020. Initially, our primary focus was Senior Housing (SH) REITs (our September 2023 Outlook on the topic) where we saw the biggest opportunity for earnings to “snap back” from COVID’s demand disruption. Our SH thesis continues to play out, but has already generated impressive outperformance. However, more recently, we have trimmed healthcare winners to redeploy into MOBs – a strategy starting to bear fruit but that we believe has more room to run.


Work From Home
A major distinction of traditional office versus healthcare office is the ability to work from home. While we did see an increased emphasis on telehealth services during the pandemic, by and large, healthcare requires patients and workers to physically enter the office. Indeed, a 2021 survey from American Community showed that only 10% of healthcare employees primarily worked from home, and the in-office requirement only increases for higher acuity patients. Conversely, based on data from Gallup, some professions exceeded 80% work from home during 2021. Overall, the risk from telehealth and work from home is minimal for high quality and well-located MOB product.
Investing in MOBs
Based on the portfolios of the underlying companies, our composites weighted average MOB exposure was 6.5% as of October 31, 2024, which is double the exposure of the RMZ. As Figure 2 highlights, we achieve our MOB exposure through investments in: American Healthcare REIT (AHR), Ventas Inc (VTR), Welltower Inc (WELL), Healthcare Realty (HR), and Sila Realty (SILA).


Within our MOB positions, it is important to distinguish multi- and single-tenant buildings, as well as triple net and gross leases. Under a triple net lease, the tenant is responsible for real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance, while, in a gross lease the landlord is responsible. Triple net buildings are popular with investors due to less operational intensity and the lack of recurring capex; however, the vacancy risk from a single tenant is more pronounced. In our view, both types of buildings possess attractive investment cases. Well-located, multi-tenant buildings should benefit from the expenditure shift between inpatient and outpatient facilities, and we primarily achieve exposure to this group through HR, WELL, and VTR. Conversely, triple net, single tenant buildings likely experience less earnings growth in the coming years; but, given the higher cap rates on acquisitions, we believe the REITs can use attractive costs of capital to accretively grow. We benefit from this exposure through our most recent investments in SILA and AHR.
For visualization purposes, Figure 3 shows a standard multi-tenant MOB. Typically, these facilities are located near major medical campuses and house numerous specialties under one roof. On the other end, Figure 4 shows a typical single tenant building. As the name implies, these assets are leased to a single user (typically under a triple net lease) and are typically located outside of major medical campuses.


Aging: Overarching Demand Driver
Before diving into specific considerations for MOBs, we should discuss the 80-year-old gorilla in the room – America is old and aging rapidly. Indeed, the youngest Baby Boomers turned 60 this year, so it should not come as a surprise that the 65+ and 80+ cohorts are both projected to have outsized population growth in the coming years. Based on forecasts from the U.S. Census Bureau, the share of the population over 65 is expected to increase from 15% today to 20% in 2030 (and to 25% in 2060). Furthermore, the 65+ cohort spends meaningfully more on healthcare than younger age groups. Combining these two factors, most experts anticipate healthcare spending to materially outpace GDP for at least the next decade. Though rapid growth bolsters all aspects of healthcare real estate, we believe MOBs are positioned particularly well to benefit from this tremendous fundamental tailwind.
In vs. Out Patient
The first important distinction to understand for MOBs is outpatient versus inpatient, which, generally speaking, is simply whether or not the patient stays “in” a facility overnight. Inpatient comprises the highest acuity patients and procedures, but the overall trend in healthcare continues to push more procedures into outpatient environments. Figure 5 highlights the bifurcation of inpatient and outpatient visits since 2000.


This trend’s driver is twofold; first, the cost to both the provider and the patient is substantially lower. Second, research also suggests patient outcomes are improved due to less hesitation to return to an outpatient facility (relative to the fear of going back to the hospital). Forecasts from the Advisory Board suggest a third of hospital revenues are in the process of transitioning to outpatient settings. From a volume perspective, over the next five years inpatient procedures are actually expected to decline by 0.7% while outpatient procedure volumes are expected to grow 10%.
Proximity and Clustering
The second qualifier is proximity to a major medical campus (e.g., distance), along with the amount of related healthcare facilities clustered in the immediate vicinity (e.g., density). Health systems – which are simply healthcare organizations consisting of at least one hospital plus a group of physicians – desire proximity to easily facilitate the movement of patients and doctors. While there are many systems around the country, readers would likely recognize some of the largest, such as HCA Healthcare (HCA), CommonSpirit Health, and Ascension Health. These systems also strive to cluster their facilities close together because of the benefit of staying “in-network”. A campus is centered around a hospital(s), but typically includes additional inpatient and outpatient facilities in the immediate vicinity. Clustering means a patient could travel to the medical center and schedule numerous appointments for one single day. From the landlord’s perspective, clustering buildings in a given market provides operational efficiencies and negotiating scale in leasing. Healthcare Realty (HR) shared an illuminating exercise in their latest presentation (see Figure 6), showing leasing statistics for markets they own over 1 million sqft versus markets with less than 250,000 sqft. Most importantly, in markets with scale, HR achieved 170 basis points (bps) uplift in occupancy and a 227-bps benefit to leasing spreads.


Specialty Exposure
The end result from well-located and high-quality facilities is exposure to the most attractive tenant types (e.g., specialty). Generally, the higher acuity a practice serves, the more specialization required within their physical office space. More specialization tends to require expensive buildouts and equipment, and thus are much more difficult to move. As an example, imaging and radiology practices requires heavy machinery and “vaults” to provide a safe environment. Conversely, a primary care buildout is relatively simple and presents more risk a tenant can move down the street for a better deal. On top of the cost considerations, proximity is very difficult to recreate given supply constraints in major medical centers. Therefore, while primary care doctors can even operate out of retail strip centers or traditional office buildings, higher acuity specializations have less flexibility for location, lending to better renewal rates. HR’s exposure by physician type compared to the broader U.S. average (as well as HR’s exposure between on/adjacent and off campus) is highlighted in Figure 7. Importantly, primary care doctors make up 35% of U.S. physicians but only 21% of HR’s tenant base. Conversely, oncology represents 3% of the broader doctor pool but is 5% of HR’s tenant base.


Supply on Life Support
On top of the land constraint in major medical centers, healthcare real estate spending largely shut down at the start of the pandemic as developers were cautious to allocate capital. Today, even as fundamentals look attractive, higher construction and financing costs have maintained a lid on new development activity. Based on current costs, replacement costs in most markets are well above in-place values. Specifically, our model calculates HR trading at a per square foot real estate value of ~$290 as of September 30, 2024, while estimated construction costs today stand at $445/sqft based on Building Design + Construction. This certainly varies by market, but broadly speaking, rents need to rise meaningfully in order to incentivize new construction. As a result, current MOB developments only account for 2.2% of existing supply nationwide (down from 3.1% in 2Q23).
Higher Retention Driving Business
With robust demand and anemic supply, the ability to push rents while still retaining existing tenants tends to increase implicitly. This trend is already emerging with 2024 retention tracking meaningfully stronger than 2023 across the MOB REITs. We are also seeing the landlord’s power show up in stronger rental increases. Historically, MOBs grew in-line with inflation, but more recently growth has accelerated to a new normal. Not only have starting rental rates increased for new leases, but MOB landlords are striking annual escalators between +3-4% vs only +2-3% historically. Additionally, stronger retention also leads to less downtime between tenants and less cash outlays from the landlord (on broker commissions and leasing incentives). Taking all these considerations into account drives a meaningful step-up in the cash flow growth profile of well-positioned MOB REITs.
Rent Coverage = Ability to Push Rent
Another important metric we use to screen a landlord’s ability to push rent is rent coverage of their tenants. Rent coverage simply equates to a tenants’ cash flow divided by their rent. As shown in Figure 8 below, rent coverage within healthcare subsectors span from only 1x in the still impacted assisted living space to over 10x for specialized outpatient buildings. Specialty practices tend to be much higher margin operations that, all else equal, are much less sensitive to rental increases than other parts of healthcare.


Return of Private Capital
Public REITs are certainly not the only investors excited about the demographic trends supporting healthcare real estate in the coming decades, but we do believe they are the best positioned. Over the past few quarters, private capital came back into MOBs in a meaningful way. A sizable chunk of this activity has come through dispositions out of REITs. As an example, HR has generated $875 million of proceeds thus far in 2024 (as of 3Q24) at a weighted average cap rate of 6.6%. It may appear counter-intuitive to sell properties as fundamentals are inflecting positively; however, HR (through share buybacks, debt repurchases, and funding capital improvements) has been able to accretively redeploy these proceeds and create value for shareholders. Another sizable chunk has come through joint ventures between private capital and public REIT operators. To continue our HR example, the company announced JVs with both Nuveen and KKR this year and anticipates leveraging the platforms for long-term growth (HR retained 20% ownership and earns both acquisition and management fees).
Conclusion
Medical Outpatient Buildings’ attractive offering of specialized office space for medical professionals presents a compelling option for REIT investors to benefit from America’s rapidly aging population. Not only are high quality MOBs benefiting from strong demand drivers, but the increase in construction/financing costs have limited supply growth, creating a perfect scenario for rent increases in the future. We expect this combination of factors to drive strong earnings growth in well-positioned MOB REITs over the coming years. Additionally, despite lower earnings growth, we also see potential outperformance in the more ratable single-tenant end of the business due to attractive acquisition spreads.

Want to stay a step ahead of this stock market? Not just in the remainder of 2024, but 2025 as well? Then you should respect one market force, but not ignore another. That’s the guidance shared by Cameron Dawson, Chief Investment Officer of NewEdge Wealth, in this MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast segment recorded on-site at our Orlando conference.

Transcript

Mike Larson: Hi there. I'm Mike Larson, host of the MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast. I'm coming to you from the MoneyShow Orlando. Today, I'm speaking with Cameron Dawson, Chief Investment Officer of NewEdge Wealth. Cameron, how are you?
Cameron Dawson: I'm wonderful. Thank you. Happy to be here.
Larson: Yeah, I'm glad you could. This is a new show for you, as I understand. So, thank you for coming. Why don't you talk a little bit about your background and what it is that NewEdge Wealth does?
Dawson: Sure. So, I've been the chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth for about two and a half years now. NewEdge Wealth is a private wealth manager that is hyper-focused on ultra-high net worth and high-net worth investors. We also have a business called NewEdge Advisors as well, which is a mass affluent platform. We invest across the asset class spectrum.
So, everything from traditional equities and fixed income, down into alternatives as well. My background coming into NewEdge Wealth is that I spent a couple of years as a chief market strategist at another RIA, but then I spent eight years working for Bank of America, where the majority of that time I was an industrials analyst.
So, I was an equity buy-side analyst getting deep into the fundamentals of companies and highly cyclical companies, which of course, lends itself quite well to making predictions about the broader economy and markets.
Larson: There you go. And of course, you're here in Orlando, your hometown. It wasn't hard to get you to come down, right?
Dawson: Most definitely. I'm born and raised in Orlando, proud to be so, and so happy to be able to come down, see some family, and meet some great people.
Larson: Excellent. Well, let's talk about this market environment. I know you're going to be giving a talk that's kind of a big picture. What are some of the themes you're seeing out there, and what are your thoughts here as we keep setting new highs?
Dawson: Yeah, it is pretty incredible. But when you put it in the context of the backdrop of this market, we think that it starts to make a lot of sense as to why we keep pressing to new highs.
What I mean by that is that is, if you think about fiscal stimulus, which remains highly supportive and stimulative, and monetary stimulus now at the same time that is shifting to a more stimulative stance... all at the same time that you have a relatively robust economy. That means you have fiscal running at full speed, monetary running at full speed, into a strong growth backdrop.
You don't see that often. Whatever the opposite of a “toxic brew” is, maybe the perfect scenario... that seems to be how risk assets are taking it. Because you can see risk assets like equities trading at 22 times forward, back almost to the peak we saw post-Covid. You see credit spreads compressing to their lowest levels since times like 2005.
So, what you have is a market that we think is very much priced for perfection. That has a few implications. It means that there's not a lot of wiggle room for downside surprise. It could mean that if growth disappoints, or let's say yields move higher, it would be a source of volatility. But it also shows you just how beneficial this backdrop or environment is. We just have to ask the question, how long can it last?
Larson: No, I understand completely. Let's talk about a couple of those things one by one, starting with the Fed and monetary stimulus. What are your thoughts on the Fed's 50-basis point move and what do you think they're going to be doing as we roll into ‘25?
Dawson: We thought it was an aggressive move. We were looking at things like growth continuing to remain resilient. Yes, we saw some fraying around the edges within the labor market. But the Fed has convinced itself that its policy is very tight and it is weighing on growth activity. And yes, that is true if you're looking at things like housing, if you're looking at manufacturing.
But when you look at the data in aggregate, what you actually see is that the entire time that the Fed has had real rates – remember, that’s your nominal fed funds rate minus inflation – the entire time that that real rate has been positive, the US economy has been growing above-trend and growth forecasts have been rising. So, it's really hard to empirically argue that you have policy today that is absolutely keeping growth at a very low level.
And the challenge that you have now is that if the Fed actually delivers on all of the cuts that it's saying it will – remember Austan Goolsbee saying we have hundreds of basis points of cuts ahead of us – then you would have the deepest, most aggressive, non-recessionary cutting cycle in the last 40 years into an environment where financial conditions are already extraordinarily - not extraordinarily loose - they're a little bit tighter than they were at the peak in ‘21, but still loose and stimulative. Which is why another attendee of this conference, Ed Yardeni, has been talking about the risk of a bubble, a melt-up. Because you're just throwing lighter fluid on a fire that's already going.
Larson: Yeah, absolutely. So, let's look at the election scenario. Obviously, that's on everybody's minds. As we're meeting, we're only three weeks out, or a little less than three weeks out, from the election. What are your thoughts on how that's going to shape things, again, given what both candidates have talked about?
Dawson: Yeah, it is interesting that typically we see volatility going into an election, and then a rally coming out of the election. So, we should not be too surprised if we have low volatility going into this one, and possibly some more volatility coming out. Because whichever way this election breaks, we know that there are potentially both deficit-increasing and growth-dampening policies that could be enacted on both sides.
If we think about it, we have to consider things like higher corporate taxes, immigration, tariffs, and trade. All of these things, if enacted by either party, could potentially weigh on growth. But you also have this promise of higher deficits, as nobody's talking about austerity. So, we think that the election could end up being volatile or a volatility-inducing event for the bond market, potentially.
And we do think that you do have this potential that some of these policies could weigh on growth. But this all comes with a really important caveat - which is that all through my career, I have been fielding calls from clients the day after an election that says, “My guy or gal didn't win, sell everything, I'm moving to Canada.” And by definition, that is the wrong move.
So, we think it's really important that investors take the emotion out of it. That they see that effectively see the market not in an election year to start, to keep that emotion at bay. Because yes, it's a personal thing to go through elections, but the market isn't personal. And so, the end result is that markets do what they do in spite of, or despite, what goes on in Washington - which is great news.
Larson: Absolutely. Let me ask you just briefly about some of the alternative investments, things like real estate. That sector, obviously, was kind of in a wasteland for a while, seems to be getting a little more momentum. We've seen gold at all-time highs and very strong this year. Any thoughts on what investors should be doing in sectors like that?
Dawson: Yeah, we think the first step within alternatives is one of making sure you know what you own and why you own it. This is absolutely imperative, because what we know with alternatives is that you give up things like liquidity, you do pay higher fees. And so, you have to be very clear as to what role an alternative investment plays in a portfolio.
From there, it's making sure that you are highly confident in the managers that you're working with. That they have deep expertise, have long histories of being in these markets through cycles. That can navigate what are, as we know with real estate, very choppy cycles. I would agree with you that real estate is creating opportunities, and we usually see disruption as a source of opportunity.
So, because of high interest rates, because of the overhang of high prices in 2021, we know we have potential opportunities within real estate, which is why we're looking for opportunistic ways in order to get exposure. And being very careful of where we are within the capital stack of real estate, preferring more debt versus equity at times.
But if we look overall and broadly, we continue to see great opportunities within alternatives, but it takes a lot of due diligence. It's a rather strenuous process because of the need to have high degrees of confidence, mostly in long-life kinds of vehicles, seven-plus years, it's imperative that you choose correctly.
Larson: Absolutely. One question, I guess I would say in the traditional stock arena, are there sectors that you're more positive about for the coming year than the last? And anything that you would probably steer people away from at this point?
Dawson: Well, we do think that there are opportunities throughout all sectors. Meaning that the way we approach our equity portfolio is that instead of being top-down and saying, “We want to overweight one sector versus another because of some top-down view,” we let the sector overweight really be driven by our bottom-up analysis. And that bottom-up analysis is all quality-based through our different strategies, whether it's large-cap growth, value, mid-cap, and international.
We define quality in very specific ways. Meaning we're looking for companies that have strong free cash flow, strong return on invested capital, stable profits through cycles, strong balance sheets. And then there are times that those kinds of companies will underperform. Junk does rally. You do have trash rallies all the time. But what we find is that through the cycle, those quality companies really do prove their worth by being able to have what we call better downside capture, meaning they go down less when markets swoon. But they also have really good upside participation, meaning that they're not sitting on their hands as the rest of the market is rallying.
There's one important point with all of that, and it’s that there are a lot of quality companies that are very expensive. So that's the last piece of it, is that we do have a valuation discipline that we put into our work to make sure that we're not paying too much for those great attributes. Because what we find is that in a year like 2022, your great quality companies drew down 30%, 40%, 50% because they got so expensive. So, that valuation discipline is a necessary component of maintaining that kind of quality.
Larson: One last question I think I want to ask is... it seems like a fairly optimistic scenario, a pretty positive outlook. What would it be, if you had to say one or two things that could derail that scenario, that could take the base case and steer us in a worse direction?
Dawson: I think the biggest risk to this market is that earnings for ‘25 and ‘26 are not properly calibrated, meaning that we have to go through an earnings revision down cycle. And when you're cutting earnings, you get a double whammy typically. You get earnings that are being trimmed, and you get valuations that are pulling in. Because when you have less confidence about your growth outlook, you tend to pay less for whatever stock or piece of credit that you're buying.
So, because we're going into ‘25 priced for perfection and growth estimates are high, the thing that we have to keep a really close eye on is if you start to see those estimates get cut and trimmed. That exposes you to de-rating the valuation and taking those growth numbers down.
And I would add one last point to that. If you look at allocations to equities - meaning, you can look at household allocations or overall fund allocations - they remain near cycle highs. Which just means that everybody is already positioned for stocks to keep on going and keep on making new highs.
So, our base case, to be conservative, in ‘25 is a bit more of a sideways and choppy market. And we actually see that as a good thing. It means that that bull market could continue versus going off and going straight up and kind of dying out in a flame of some kind.
Larson: Yeah, an Ed Yardeni scenario. Too much of a boom, too much of a good thing, I guess - you don't want to see that.
Dawson: Exactly. Because what comes after melt-ups is melt-downs. So, we would see a growing into the valuation multiple, a little bit of choppiness within the market, as actually something welcome as long-term investors. Even if it is something that will be a little bit jarring as we go through it because we've been used to this “up and to the right” market.
So, the bar is high for expectations. But at the end of the day, we never want to bet against the great American might of earnings growth. It's been incredible. So, we think that, at least in the short term, our view has been one of “Respect the uptrend, but don't ignore the risks.”
Larson: Perfect. I think that's a great way to end things. Cameron, thank you so much for taking some time out to chat.
Dawson: Thanks for having me.

 -  Arista Networks has exceeded growth expectations in the AI networking market, overcoming competition from Nvidia and Broadcom.
 -  The company aims for $750 million in AI networking revenue by 2025 within an estimated $60 billion market.
 -  Arista's revenue is projected to grow 16-18% this year, with high operating margins expected to reach 47.8% in FY24.
 -  2024 earnings multiple may be elevated but strong top line and bottom-line growth in 2025 warrants a Buy recommendation.


Investment Thesis

Earlier this year, when I published a research note about my Buy recommendation for Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), investor sentiment was rife with skepticism about the growth possibilities of Arista Networks.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was pushing for its InfiniBand adoption in conjunction with the deployment of its most-wanted GPUs that are essential accelerating blocks for today’s AI data center, while Silicon Valley neighbor Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) was also firing up competition with the launch of its AI networking-focused Jericho3-AI switch ASIC. Both these two peers were expected to dampen Arista Networks’ penetration plans in a rapidly growing, high-margin AI networking market.
However, Arista Networks has done well to not only outperform markets but also outshine some of its peers on the stock market as the company continues to march on with its ambitions of deepening its presence in the Ethernet networking market for AI data centers, a networking technology different from what Arista’s peers sell to its customers.


At the heart of its ambitions is Arista Networks’ goal to deliver $750 million in AI networking revenues by penetrating a target market that it estimates to be ~$60 billion.
Arista Networks has shown no signs of stopping so far and continues to warrant a Buy rating per my analysis as the company heads into earnings next week.

Arista Networks' Battle For AI Networking Dominance Is Fierce

Arista Networks is currently delivering ~$6.3 billion in consolidated revenues, growing at a pace of ~20% per the Q2 quarter on a TTM basis. While the growth rate of Arista’s revenues is expected to remain in the high-teens range of ~16-18% this year, growth is expected to ramp up next year, and investors will be keenly looking for commentary from Arista’s management about the same.
So far, the marginal uptick in growth that Arista’s management expected in the back half of the year has already shown some traces in the past Q2 report, where revenue grew 16%. This was much better than what Street’s analysts had been expecting.


In the Q2 earnings call, Arista’s management updated investors on how their progress has been on moving further towards their 2025 target of achieving $750 million in AI networking revenues with the might of their Ethernet-focused networking products and software.
Per the 650 group, a networking focused market research agency, AI networking is expected to surge to $20 billion in 2025, with Arista and Nvidia the largest players who are expected to push their own respective networking technologies, Ethernet and InfiniBand, to their customers.


In the Q2 earnings call, Arista revealed how the company was trailing its Etherlink AI platform with its global top 5 customers and had already won 4 of 5 customers away from Nvidia. Arista’s Etherlink platform comprises a combination of the company’s popular 7060X6 and 7800R4 AI Spine switches that support 51.2 Tbps of 800G Ethernet ports, as well as Arista’s EOS (Extensible Operating System). According to management, 2024 will be “a year of new product introductions, new customers, and expanded use cases,” so more updates about trials will be much appreciated.
Investors will be expecting more updates from management on how much closer the success of these trials will get Arista Networks to its $750 million AI networking revenue 2025 target and how much deeper it can penetrate the $60 billion target market.


I would also be interested in hearing from Arista’s management about CloudVision, a network operating system similar to EOS, and how it plans to position its software platform to tie up the management needs of its Ethernet products. In the last call, management explained how it has started seeing a bump in its software subscriptions, increasingly due to CloudVision being that “second building block for us [them] that's going strong.”
Early days for Arista’s software ambitions, but this could be another high-margin growth vector for the Ethernet networking company that continues to gain clients with its updated line of Ethernet networking products and services. The strength in Arista's Ethernet product-driven revenues so far led management to humorously point out in the Q2 call how Arista Networks is ""making Ethernet great again.""

Upgrading Arista Networks’ Price Targets

Per my previous research note, I had expected Arista to deliver ~14-15% revenue growth through FY25. But the progress the company has started showing already indicates that Arista Networks could easily achieve 16-17% growth this year alone, with scope of revenue growth to expand to ~18% next year.
I am also updating my adj. operating margin expectations for the company to deliver 46.5% adj. margins in FY24, but again, the company’s management is ahead of the curve, and I expect the company to now grow its margins to 47.8% next year.
With these growth rates, Arista Networks is expected to deliver 21.4% of earnings growth next year on revenue growth of ~18%, which should fetch a valuation of ~45x 2025 earnings. However, the company is valued at 40.7x 2025 earnings, which implies ~11-12% further upside in the stock, indicating a PT of $434.



Risks & Other Factors To Look For

A big factor in supporting my forecast is the recent commentary coming from a few hyperscaler customers of Arista Networks, such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META), who have strongly indicated they will continue to scale their capex investments in upgrading and adding to their AI data center infrastructure that includes networking components from Arista Networks. Investors may not have taken the earnings results of those hyperscalers well since their revenue forecasts were marginally lower than expected, but I view this as quarterly distortions that should eventually average out since the longer-term growth story stays intact.
Further, investors should take note of what is expected from Arista Networks in the earnings report next week:
Q3 2024: Markets expect the company to report $2.08 earnings per share on revenues worth $1.76 billion, growing ~16.4% y/y. This is higher than the $1.75 billion upper guidance range target that management set for itself, so there will be elevated volatility if Arista misses this estimate.
Forward Guidance: With Q4 guidance expected, markets now expect earnings per share of $8.29 on revenues of $6.83 billion, growing 16.5% y/y. My base case here is for management to guide slightly higher here, which might probably cause some near-term volatility, but I believe Arista Networks would resume its uptrend once the broader narrative takes hold again. 47x 2024 earnings may be questioned by many investors, but I still believe Arista is undervalued versus its 2025 earnings.

Takeaway

The battle for the AI data center’s networking market is fierce, with Arista Networks and its peers focused on taking a larger share of their customers' networking budgets. But Arista’s repertoire of Ethernet networking products continues to gain traction among the company’s target market of customers, with the company racking up customer wins, and I expect the momentum to continue.
Despite the elevated valuation levels at 47x 2024 earnings, I continue to recommend a Buy on Arista Networks due to the discount in valuation premiums observed versus 2025 earnings.

 -  Abercrombie's stock is down 30% since May as most investors are concerned about slower growth in the year’s second half, especially in Q4.
 -  Despite this concern, the fundamentals of the company are solid, with robust revenue growth, improved margins, minimal debt, and strong operating and free cash flows.
 -  Increased SG&A spending from promotional and marketing efforts could impact Q4 profitability, especially since the holiday season usually involves heavy discounting.
 -  Liquidity is strong, with significant cash reserves and zero long-term debt after debt repayments in Q2.
 -  I maintain a Hold rating for now. However, I could upgrade to a buy following Q3 earnings results and management's updates on full-year guidance. My main concern prior to Q3 earnings is a sell-off similar to Q2.


Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) has been an outstanding performer in the apparel retail industry, outperforming the S&P 500 over the last five years by more than 600%.
Despite these impressive returns, the share price has seen a recent pullback, with the stock declining over 30% since reaching its peak in May.
Therefore, I decided to examine the reasons behind this pullback to determine if this is a normal correction or an early warning sign.
I will advance here that one of the main factors in this pullback is the cautious outlook management has provided for the second half of the year, particularly in Q4.
In my view, the company’s fundamentals and valuation ratios look quite decent when compared to its peers. However, at the moment, I maintain a Hold rating as there is a high risk for a selloff following Q3 2024 results, similar to what happened after the Q2 earnings release.
However, I will reconsider my rating after the Q3 results, particularly based on any updates from management regarding full-year guidance, and Q4 outlook.

Price Action

Over the last five years, the company has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 600%.
When compared to some of its industry peers, the company is well ahead of its competitors by a wide margin.


However, since the peak in May this year, the share price has declined by over 30%. Let's understand why.

Uncertainty In The Back Half Of The Year

During the Q1 earnings conference, management hinted at the possibility of slower growth in the second half of the year.
In the second quarter, management raised full-year net sales growth to 12%-13% YoY, up from the previously guided 10%.
However, they are taking a cautious approach for Q4, projecting sales growth of about 6.5-7.5%, which is lower than the low double-digit growth anticipated for Q3.
It seems that shareholders didn't like the uncertainty surrounding the end of the year, with the share price dropping by 17% following the release of Q2 earnings.
To better understand if this (mini) sell-off was justified, let's take a closer look at the fundamentals of the company.

Fundamentals

The income statement shows consistent double-digit revenue growth since Q2 2023.
More recently, this increase was driven by the Hollister brand recovery, which experienced a 17% increase in sales. Additionally, the company has expanded its reach to new customer demographics (mainly, millennials and Gen Z) through the NFL collections.
However, one of the challenges that the company is currently facing is the increased reliance on promotions and marketing, especially for the Abercrombie brand. Management has already indicated that Q4 is typically its most promotional quarter. Therefore, any increase in discounting could offset some of the gross profit improvements achieved in the first half​ of the year.
As a matter of fact, the company is using half of its revenue for SG&A expenses, which is significantly above the average of the industry.


However, the main reason I am not overly concerned about their marketing and promotional spending is due to their operating and net margins, which are above the apparel retail industry.
Moving on to the balance sheet, the company has significantly reduced its net debt over the last year, from $538 million in Q2 2023 to $152 million in Q2 2024.
Tangible book value per share has increased to $23.6, and cash per share is up as well, to $14.5.
The liquidity ratios look quite decent, especially the cash ratio when compared to its industry peers.


A quick look at the cash flow statement shows a significant cash outflow as the company reduced its debt by redeeming all outstanding 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, totaling $214 million.
As a result, the company has no long-term debt and no outstanding borrowings on its $500 million revolving credit line.
Over the last 12 months, cash from operations increased by 47%. Among the drivers was a decrease in inventory levels and revenue growth, already mentioned above.

Valuation

Despite the 632% return over the last 5 years, the valuation ratios don't look bad at all.


I believe the pullback since May has helped bring some valuation ratios down to more reasonable levels.
Additionally, despite outperforming the return of all its competitors, the company doesn't look overvalued when using EV/EBITDA as the comparison metric.



Conclusion

To wrap up, despite the spectacular growth of the company, its decent margins, favorable recent price action, and reasonable valuation ratios, I maintain a Hold rating for this company.
I believe there's a strong risk that the pullback could keep pushing the share price down after the Q3 earnings release on November 26.
Management already expressed their concerns for the last quarter of the year, with sales growth projected in the mid-single digits, compared to low double digits achieved in the past 5 consecutive quarters. Shareholders could see this slowdown as a negative sign, potentially leading to a selloff following the earnings release (similar to what happened in Q2 2024, where the share price declined by 17% due to these concerns).
If there is such a pullback following the Q3 earnings release, then I will reconsider my Hold rating. However, I need to see first an update on management's outlook on the full-year results, before I can upgrade my rating to a buy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732373-microsoft-q1-a-rare-buying-opportunity-emerges,4732373,Microsoft Q1: A Rare Buying Opportunity Emerges,"Summary

 -  While Microsoft's FY1Q25 revenue beat may sound positive, most of that beat came from the More Personal Computing segment, with Azure only coming in in-line with expectations.
 -  Azure's 34% growth in FY1Q25 is in-line with expectations, but management guided to Azure growth of 31% to 32% next quarter, missing expectations by 1 percentage point.
 -  The key reason for the miss was due to third-party infrastructure providers that are delaying the bringing online of data center capacity.
 -  In turn, because the AI services portion of Azure is largely supply constrained, I expect that in the second half of FY2025, with easing of supply constraints, Microsoft should see an reacceleration in growth due to Azure.
 -  I am Simple Investing, a former manager of a hedge fund with over $1B in AUM and a strong track record. I now run the investing group Outperforming the Market, where I share my Barbell Portfolio.


Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted a rare disappointing quarter, which resulted in share price weakness post earnings.
While revenue in the current FY1Q25 quarter was above guidance, most of the beat came from the less strategic More Personal Computing segment, while Azure’s 34% growth was largely in-line with expectations this quarter.
That said, the guidance for Azure of between 31% to 32% fell short of expectations by 1 percentage point.
This was largely due to the pushout of data center capacity from third-party providers, which I will explain in greater detail later, while the consumption trends for Azure was stable.
A stable Azure consumption trend may not be what investors were looking for as well, as the market was expecting an uplift in IT spending in the second half of the calendar year.
As such, it is clear to me that Azure remains supply constrained, and that if these capacity ramps expected in the third and fourth quarters of FY2025 comes in, growth in Azure will accelerate alongside this.
Another positive from the quarter was the strength in the margin control as operating margins beat the high end of its guidance by 130 basis points despite pressures on gross margin due to the scaling of AI infrastructure
In my opinion, this will be key to restoring investor confidence as investors are growing increasingly cautious about Microsoft’s guidance outlook given multiple mentions of supply pushouts, which I will explain more below.
All in all, I think this creates a rare buying opportunity for a very high quality big tech company, as I will elaborate in greater detail in the article. I have written about Microsoft on Seeking Alpha, and in my previous article, where I made the case that Microsoft was investing into the AI opportunity and whether this investment is yielding a sufficient enough return on investment. In this article, I argue that the fact that we are seeing such a strong demand from Microsoft Azure AI services such that supply is unable to catch up does suggest that there are increasingly more evidences that the investments into scaling up AI infrastructure is one that will determine the future growth rates of Azure, and thus, Microsoft, going forward.

FY1Q25 analysis overview

Against the high end of guidance of $64.8 billion, Microsoft’s revenue came in with a solid $800 million beat at $65.6 billion in this September, FY1Q25 quarter.
This meant that on a constant currency basis, revenues grew 16%, which is impressive, in my view, given Microsoft’s scale.
However, this is why I think the stock is not performing well after this considerable feat.
The quality of the revenue beat matters here, and what I found is that out of the solid $800 million beat in revenues this quarter, about $530 million of that beat came from the More Personal Computing segment, which is the PC or hardware focused segment for Microsoft, as both Gaming and Search beat the initial guide they had set out.
Of course, investors these days are focused on Azure given it is a key growth driver for the company.
So, how did Azure perform?
On the surface, Azure revenue growth came in at 34% on a constant currency basis, which was a 1 percentage point beat compared to its guide of 33%.
More importantly, I think, is the sequential revenue dollar growth Azure posted, which was $1.21 billion.
This is the largest ever sequential revenue dollar growth performance that Azure posted.
The good news here is that Azure did not see any material change in the broader macro spending backdrop, which means that things were no worse, but no better either.
This actually brings me to the bad news because it does disappoint investors who have been anticipating something of a second half improvement in IT spending.
However, the bad news does not stop there, as guidance for the second quarter in December came in 1 percentage point lighter than expected, with the guidance for Azure constant currency revenue growth to be between 31% to 32%.
One of the main positives from the quarter was margin control because despite the pressure on gross margins from AI infrastructure scaling, operating margins came in at 46.6%, which was well ahead of the top end of its operating margin guidance for the first quarter of 45.3%.
For the first quarter, capital expenditures came in at $20 billion, up from the $19 billion in capital expenditures for the fourth quarter and Microsoft expects this figure to grow from the first quarter to the second quarter.
As you would expect, most of the capital expenditures are spent on investments in its cloud and AI business.

Azure concerns

As highlighted above, Azure revenue growth in the first quarter was 34% on a constant currency basis, which was a 1 percentage point ahead of guidance and on a sequential revenue dollar growth basis, Azure grew $1.21 billion.
I would also note that Google Cloud also brought in a sequential revenue dollar growth of $1.0 billion, which is a record for the company as well.
Both Google Cloud and Azure’s record sequential revenue dollar growth does indicate that the cloud service providers are seeing very strong demand trends, which is an encouraging sign in my view.


However, I would like to focus more on the guidance and outlook for Azure.
While a 1 percentage point miss for Azure constant currency revenue growth is not that significant, I think investors are more triggered by the reasons for the miss.
So, what were the reasons for the miss in guidance?
The company attributed the miss to the “supply pushouts"", which was highlighted multiple times during its earnings call.
This means that Microsoft expects that in the second quarter ending December and third quarter ending March, there will be a delay in the data center capacity from third-party infrastructure providers like Oracle and CoreWeave.
I think why this is disappointing to investors is because Microsoft actually should have already accounted for some delays in its guidance in the prior quarter, but with this, it does imply to me that there is further slippage of the going live of the data center capacity from these third-party infrastructure providers.
As such, I think what is safe to assume is that the third-party infrastructure providers like Oracle and CoreWeave likely experienced delays. The problem will then be whether these delays will be prolonged or not, given that it is not within the control of Microsoft.
This is the reason I think Microsoft sold off after the first quarter results, as investors have been hearing of the supply pushouts for a few quarters now and the guidance that management gives seems to be at risk.
For now, Microsoft reaffirmed its guidance for an acceleration in Azure in the third and fourth quarters ending March and June respectively, with the assumption that capacity does come in during the third and fourth quarters.
The key here is the conviction in the outlook and capacity addition as it does affect Azure growth for FY2025.
Just three months ago, Microsoft sort of implied that the second quarter Azure revenue should end up close to the 34% growth in the first quarter, which then implies the first half revenue growth of Azure should be 34%.
However, today, with Azure revenue growth landing at 34% in the first quarter and if Microsoft achieves the high end of its Azure guidance of 32%, the implied first half revenue growth of Azure is now just 33%, one point lower.
In my view, I was modelling around 36% revenue growth for Azure in the third and fourth quarters, which indicates a modest acceleration.
If the capacity does come online in the third and fourth quarters as management expects, I think this revenue growth of Azure I was modelling could still be achieved.

Azure AI constrained while non-AI stable

Microsoft stated that AI services brought about a 12-point contribution to Azure growth in the first quarter, and that this was stable relative to the fourth quarter. Management expects that in the second quarter, AI services will contribute a “similar” amount to Azure growth, which also implies a 12-point contribution from AI services.
I think more importantly, management stated in its earnings call that “demand continues to be higher than its available capacity” within AI services, which does imply that it remains supply constrained on this front.
Microsoft’s AI revenues on an annualized basis are expected to reach $10 billion by the next quarter.
This means that the combined M365 Copilot and Azure AI revenues are expected to not only be one of the biggest AI businesses out there today, but it is also one of the fastest growing businesses within Microsoft in its operating history.
Based on the numbers provided above on AI services contribution and that Azure growth came in at 34% this quarter, non-AI Azure growth is implied to be 22%. This was just a 1 percentage point deceleration from the prior quarter, which does imply to me that there is no improvement in spending trends this quarter, nor was there any worsening of the trends, which does imply consumption patterns remained stable.
Given that Azure’s consumption patterns were stable, this once again does imply that the deceleration in Azure from 35% in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year to 34% in the first quarter and then to between 31% and 32% in the second quarter to all be a result of this timing of data center capacity being ready for deployment.

Productivity and Business Processes

The Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 13% from the prior year, stable relative to the prior quarter.
M365 Commercial Cloud growth came in at 16% on a constant currency in the first quarter, but as I will explain more below, M365 Commercial Cloud revenues are expected to decelerate by 2 percentage points.
The seat growth in the first quarter came in at 8%, with Microsoft guiding seat growth to moderate, which explains the 2-percentage points deceleration in M365 Cloud growth.
I suspected that M365 Copilot should be helped provide incremental M365 Commercial cloud growth by lifting ARPU, and this was further reinforced by management during its earnings call. There were also multiple examples management gave about large enterprises buying more seats for M365 Copilot, with UBS and Vodafone being highlighted.

Valuation

I’ll just briefly share the assumptions in my financial forecasts before sharing more about the valuation of the company.
I assume FY2025 revenue growth of 15%, with the assumption that after the first quarter revenue growth of 34% in Azure, that we will see that growth come down to 32% in the second quarter, and with the second half Azure growth being 36% on average.
This acceleration depends on and assumes that the capacity constraints that the company is facing today are resolved, and this continues to be what Microsoft has been reiterating as well, which again signals its confidence on the matter.
On operating margins, I assume a 100-basis point decline to 43.4% in FY2025, which is in-line with management’s expectations, given continued gross margin pressures from AI infrastructure scaling, which is offset by disciplined control on operating expenses.
That leads to an EPS of $13.18 per share for 2025.


My 1-year price target for Microsoft is $461.
This is based on applying a 35x FY2025 P/E multiple to the EPS for 2025 mentioned above.
Microsoft trades at a 5-year average P/E of 35x.
In addition, Microsoft trades at a premium P/E multiple to its peer group, which includes the likes of ServiceNow (NOW), Oracle (ORCL), Alphabet (GOOG), Salesforce (CRM), amongst others, which trades at a 31x P/E multiple.
This premium is more than justified in my view, largely due to Microsoft’s larger and faster growing AI opportunity relative to these peers, alongside its strong execution across its diversified business segments, which provide a more resilient business model relative to peers.

Conclusion

There are two camps with differing points of view today. The first believes that the capacity constraints are likely at its worst, with an acceleration coming in the third and fourth quarters of FY2025, while the second camp is more doubtful about whether we will see a re-acceleration in the second half of FY2025.
I would be a buyer of Microsoft on weakness as I belong in the camp that believes that the capacity constraints should alleviate in the coming quarters, with the third and fourth quarters of FY2025 being the key period of acceleration for the company.
Furthermore, despite the consumption trends and the macro spending backdrop seems stable, Azure saw its largest ever sequential revenue dollar growth, alongside Google Cloud, which really highlights the very strong and healthy demand trends these cloud service providers have in today’s environment.
All in all, I think this all creates a rare buying opportunity for Microsoft.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732336-noisiest-10-days-of-year,4732336,The Noisiest 10 Days Of The Year,"Summary

 -  So far, at least, there hasn’t been much to alter the longstanding market narrative of a soft landing with the continuation of the growth cycle at a more moderate pace.
 -  PCE came in right about where expected, and the headline number (which the Fed doesn’t care as much about but which is more important for actual households) is now at 2.1 percent.
 -  Jobs data was noisy, with a survey from ADP showing better than expected job gains.


Here is what has happened, is happening and will happen between this past Tuesday, October 29, and next Thursday, November 7: the third quarter US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report; the September Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation report – the one the Fed pays the most attention to – the September jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; the highly consequential US election; and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that is expected to end with another cut to the Fed funds target rate.
Not to mention a bevy of quarterly earnings reports from companies including tech behemoths Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META). All this furor, in a span of just ten days.

Not Much To Change the Script

So far, at least, there hasn’t been much to alter the longstanding market narrative of a soft landing with the continuation of the growth cycle at a more moderate pace. In the realm of corporate earnings reports, much was made of a “disappointing” report from Microsoft on Wednesday.
Disappointing in the sense that the forward guidance for sales in the company’s Azure segment (cloud services) was “only” 31-32 percent, at the lower end of analysts’ expectations. Meta took a hit in the market over concerns about AI-related capital expenditures, while Google and Amazon got a tailwind from upbeat AI commentary.
All told, the main takeaway from the AI debate seems to be that nothing much changed. If you are in the camp that sees this as just the latest iteration of tech bubble mania, you can make your case. If you think it is a productivity-enhancing game changer, you can likewise make your case. The debate goes on.
Likewise with the macro data. PCE came in right about where expected, and the headline number (which the Fed doesn’t care as much about but which is more important for actual households) is now at 2.1 percent.
Jobs data was noisy, with a survey from ADP showing better than expected job gains, while Friday’s BLS report showed a much lower number of nonfarm payroll gains, due in no small part to the twin effects of the Boeing (BA) strike (adding to an overall decrease of 46,000 jobs in manufacturing) and the late September/early October damage caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton.
The unemployment rate remains unchanged at 4.1 percent. Real GDP in the third quarter grew at a healthy pace of 2.8 percent, slightly more than expected and in line with recent quarters. Net-net, the soft landing narrative remains intact.

Votes and Rates

Much of America has already voted; turnout at early voting sites across the country has reached record numbers. By Tuesday evening all the votes will be in, though in many places including some of the most consequential battleground states (ahem, Pennsylvania) the counting is likely to go on for several more days at least.
Whether or not we know anything definitive by Wednesday morning about who will be occupying the White House and the two chambers of Congress, we should at least have a sense as to the likelihood or not of a sweeping mandate in one direction or the other.
Wall Street, in time-honored fashion, would likely be in its sunniest frame of mind if it looks like a split decision, with both parties claiming at least one of the three prizes on hand. That could put a restraint on the recent upward trend of intermediate-term interest rates.
More voting happens on Thursday, when the FOMC is likely to decide that another cut of 0.25 percent is warranted for the Fed funds target rate. That was the base case coming out of the FOMC’s Summary Economic Projections in September, and there really hasn’t been much since then that would seem to argue for a change of mind.
We could always get a surprise, of course, but this Fed has managed to stay pretty surprise-free while engineering the two years of monetary tightening and then easing back into deliberative rate cuts. We don’t expect that to change.
There is plenty at stake for us as a country, and a lot that we will have to navigate through regardless of how the election turns out. The good news is that we have a strong economy that appears well positioned to continue delivering healthy results as we head into 2025.
The Economist magazine – as sober-minded a journal as there is – was not wrong when its cover last week featured a wad of dollar bills blasting into space alongside the heading “The Envy of the World.” We have our problems, but a weak economy is not one of them.

By Jennifer Nash
The latest employment report showed 12,000 jobs were added in October, virtually unchanged, and well below forecasts of the expected addition of 106,000 new jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%.
Here is an excerpt from the Employment Situation Summary released this morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics:
Here is a snapshot of the monthly change in nonfarm employment over the last 3 years.

For another view, here is the monthly percent change in nonfarm employment since 2000. We've added a 12-month moving average to highlight the long-term trend. The latest 12-month moving average is at 181,000, down from the prior month and its lowest level since March 2021.

The next chart shows the pattern of unemployment, recessions and the S&P composite since 1948. Unemployment is usually a lagging indicator that moves inversely with equity prices (top series in the chart). Note the increasing peaks in unemployment in 1971, 1975 and 1982.
The mirror relationship repeats itself with the previous bear markets. The COVID pandemic briefly showed the same type of relationship between equities and unemployment, though the impact was temporary and irrational exuberance took over once again.
The latest unemployment rate is at 4.145% (to three decimal places).

Now let's take a look at the unemployment rate as a recession indicator or more specifically the cyclical troughs in the unemployment rate (UR) as a recession indicator. The next chart features a 12-month moving average of the UR with the troughs highlighted. The current unemployment rate of 4.05% (to two decimal places) is above the latest 12-month moving average of 3.92% (to two decimal places).
As the inset table shows, the correlation between the MA troughs and recession starts is remarkably close. The latest trough in the series occurred 12 months ago in June 2023, where the 12-month moving average of the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since January 1970.

Here's another chart to illustrate the reality of the unemployment rate - the unemployment rate divided by the labor force participation rate. We are currently at 6.6%, up from 6.5% the previous month.


The next chart shows the unemployment rate for the civilian population unemployed 27 weeks and over. This rate has fallen significantly since its 4.4% all-time peak in April 2010. After the COVID pandemic, the rate reached as high as 2.6% but has since fallen.
The unemployment rate for the civilian population unemployed 27 weeks and over is now at 1%, unchanged from the previous month and the highest level since February 2022.

The next chart is an overlay of the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. This is the ratio of the number of employed people to the total civilian population age 16 and over.

The inverse correlation between the two series is obvious. We can also see the accelerating growth of women in the workforce and two-income households in the early 1980s.
Before the COVID pandemic, the employment-population was range-bound between 54.9% and 64.7% - the lower end harkens back to when Eisenhower was president of a country of one-income households, the Korean War was still underway, and rumors were circulating that soft drinks would soon be sold in cans.
In April 2020, because of the global pandemic, we saw the employment-population ratio drop to its lowest level in series history to 51.3%. Since then, it has been gradually climbing to its pre-pandemic range, with the latest ratio at 60.2%, up slightly from the previous month.
For a confirming view of the secular change the US is experiencing on the employment front, the next chart illustrates the labor force participation rate. We're at 62.6%, down slightly from the previous month.

The employment-population ratio and participation rate will be interesting to watch going forward. The first wave of boomers will continue to be a downward force on this ratio. The oldest of them were eligible for early retirement when the Great Recession began, and the transition of the boomer cohort to full retirement age won't end until 2030.
What is the average length of unemployment? As the next chart illustrates, we are perhaps seeing a paradigm shift - the result of global outsourcing and efficiencies of technology. The latest monthly figure shows the average duration is at 22.9 weeks, well below the 40.7-week all-time high in late 2011.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' broadest measure of unemployment is the U6 series, which includes the total unemployed, plus all marginally attached workers plus total employed part-time for economic reasons. This series dates from 1994.

The U6 series is currently at 7.7%, unchanged from the previous month.
Notes: The start date of 1948 in the charts above was determined by the earliest monthly employment data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The best source for the historical data is the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
