Blending my financial chops with the timeless wisdom of value investing (and love for steady income), I’ve built a rock-solid pillar in my financial foundation through dividend investing. I believe it’s one of the most accessible paths to achieving financial freedom, and I’m excited to share my insights with you. I’m a finance professional with deep experience in M&A and business valuation. What does that mean in practice? I’ve evaluated countless businesses and played key roles in sell-side and buy-side transactions, guiding clients through the complexities of buying and selling companies. In my day-to-day work, I dive into financial modelling, conduct commercial and financial due diligence to assess a company’s health, negotiate deal terms, and, of course, attend way too many meetings :) My focus spans sectors like tech, real estate, software, finance, and consumer staples - industries I’ve spent years advising and now invest in personally. Today, they make up the core of my portfolio and coverage on this platform. My motivation for writing on Seeking Alpha comes from a desire to not only deepen my own knowledge but also to share value with others who are on a similar path. Dividend investing has played a key role in my financial journey, and I believe it’s one of the most straightforward and accessible ways for anyone to work towards financial freedom. By sharing my insights and experiences, I hope to demystify the process, making it more approachable for those looking to build long-term wealth. Ultimately, my goal is to help facilitate OUR journey to financial freedom, learning and growing together as we navigate the world of dividend investing.",None,None,None,None,,,,93,,,830,952,1.29K,13,2024-10-31

After leaving public accounting in 2010, I have been the CFO of two privately held companies with sales between $50m and $100m in both the aerospace and defense and beauty industries. At my core, I like to think of myself as a value investor, though I will step into other disciplines if I think it makes sense. I have been investing since 1999, so I have seen a few different market cycles and have tried my hand a many different philosophies over the years. I still believe that the Buffett / Munger style of buying a wonderful business at a fair price is the best path but I keep an open mind to all ideas. As a CPA, I am obviously very comfortable with numbers but I need more than just a company that meets financial metrics in order to invest. I believe in heavy research of a company not just before investing but more importantly during the lifetime of the investment. That means quarterly checkups on financials, conference calls and keeping up with the news. Despite this activity, my goal is to do nothing but hold and reinvest any dividends back into the business. The less I buy or sell, the better. My goal as a contributor is to engage the audience which will help to fully analyze a position. In investing as in life, I like to look at all sides of a situation and not merely listen to opinions that I agree with. In any investment, there are positives and there are risks.

My interest in financial markets started about 5 years ago when I accidentally came across a video about trading. That was the spark that introduced me to a new world, but over time I realized that it was not my path: too many charts, lines, and not very concrete concepts for a pragmatic person like me. I needed something different and that I found in fundamental analysis. It is a totally different approach and one that evaluates the actual results achieved by a company rather than the candlesticks made by its price per share. That was the turning point for me and I have not stopped learning ever since. I mainly invest in stocks and ETFs; I prefer US companies but I often analyze European or Chinese companies as well. Being young, my investments always have a very long-term view; I often take a contrarian view. One of the sectors that interests me the most is banking, as I believe it is fundamental to understanding the health of an economy. I am also interested in Macroeconomics.Seeking Alpha is a way for me to express my opinion and meet new people.

Conversely, other businesses are likely to face rising costs and diseconomies of scale. In addition, economies are becoming increasingly dominated by asset light businesses, and the need for infrastructure investments is declining over time. As a result, a large pool of capital is chasing a limited set of investment opportunities, which is driving up asset prices and compressing risk premia over time.Durant has undergraduate degrees in engineering and finance from the University of Adelaide (Honors) and an MBA from Nanyang Technological University (Dean’s Honors List).

In the summer of 2021, I left the city and moved in a yurt I built in the boreal forest. I went from living in downtown Toronto to living alone in the woods approximately 100km away from the closest paved road or grocery store.In an attempt to find out who I truly am, I purposely destroyed my previous life and burned it to the ground. I am in the process of being born again, and I know the next few years will be the most incredible of my life.The longer I stay in the woods, the deeper I understand the fundamental role of energy and commodities. Self-sufficiency does not exist, whether in nature or in society. On a personal level, I simply replaced my relationships with grocery stores and utility providers with natural ecosystems, and, ultimately, with God. I did not become self-sufficient. I merely changed on whom I am depending on. Knowing that I am able to fulfill all of my basic needs even when alone in the woods allowed me to replace with love the feeling of anxiety that I had in the city. I now have the deep conviction that I have the capacity to thrive in almost any environment. There is a shock at the beginning, but over time, I learn from my mistakes, and I grow into my new environment. Although my relationship with financial markets changed over time, my passion is still alive and well. I deeply understand the importance of timing when it comes to going against the crowd, as it ran over me a few times before. I am more comfortable on the periphery of a crowd while trying to anticipate where the mass is moving next.The rule is that I am generally too early when entering a trade. For example, I got involved in the uranium trade in early 2015, and the cycle took much longer to turn than I had initially expected. Once the bull run began in 2021, I was out of the trade as my patience got exhausted. Although it is far from being my only mistake of this kind, it is a big one. Getting the thesis right is the easiest part. Getting the timing right is the hardest part. Only when those two variables are combined that big money is made, and only masters of their art can do it. My previous mistakes indicate that I still have much to learn before becoming one of them. My journey on financial markets started when I was 14. After almost a decade in the investment industry and two years alone in the woods, I understand that my journey is spiritual. For this reason, comparing my returns to those of other people or other indices is self-defeating. My only basis of comparison is my former self and nothing else. My goal is to grow as a human being, to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to be better next time. If I can learn something from the mistakes of others, it is a bonus, but it is easier said than done. It is my own mistakes that provided the bulk of my experience.Writing has always been an essential part of my research process. Now that I am independent, I wish to make my research available to everyone, instead of a select group of individuals, as it has been for the last decade or so. This profile should be seen as the personal notebook of a personal life journey. I am not here to teach anything to anyone, I am here to share.I can only guarantee that I will make missteps along the way. If I get something right, tell yourself that I got lucky. I do not recommend anything to anyone, and if you read what I write too seriously, you may end up alone in the woods, so be careful.",https://twitter.com/BujonCapital,BujonCapital,None,None,,,,17,,,47,46,175,1,2024-10-31

I also do professional background checks of each insider who purchased shares after the recent sell-off. I use technical analysis to optimize the entry and exit points of my positions.
