Whenever we're on the edge of a recession, there's always a rising consternation or fear about financial institutions' safety and vitality. Having personally worked in multiple financial institutions over decades, I understand both the cause for concern and the lack of knowledge about the health of financial institutions. Moreover, working behind the curtain, I have learned more about how financial institutions truly operate. It's often interesting that the loudest advocates of the ill health financial institutions within the United States either profit from those explanations or seem to have external reasons for why they think financial institutions are unhealthy.
After the Great Depression, the government set up a structure to ensure that consumer deposits received a pre-determined level of insurance coverage. This insurance coverage is designed to protect you should your bank fail. As an insured individual, you need to recognize that this coverage is limited. If you have more than $250,000 in any financial institution, then the excess, depending on various requirements, is no longer covered. This means that if you're a higher net wealth individual, it would be wise to have accounts at multiple financial institutions to ensure that you're covered. If you're sitting with $1,000,000 in a single bank account at a single financial institution, you're putting a significantly greater amount at risk.
Whenever you read someone warning you about the health of the financial sector, be sure to see if they're immediately selling a product right after. If they're telling you that there's going to be a multi-decade depression and all the banks are going to collapse, ask them where they keep their money and how they go to the store and buy things. Nine times out of 10, they're going to be using a debit or a credit card connected to those same financial institutions.
Our financial institutions remain a wonderful source of recurrent income because they play a vital role in the economy. As long as you believe our economy will continue to progress, having exposure to financial institutions can be very wise.
Let's look closer.
In recent weeks, the U.S. banking sector has been reporting Q3 earnings. The biggest banks, JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citibank (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) all beat analyst earnings estimates, driven by the investment banking business. The period July 1 to Sept. 30, 2024, was one of high anticipation of rate cuts, followed by a sizeable 50bps cut toward the end of the quarter. One theme was consistent across the conference calls – economic activity is picking up, with clients eager to strike deals and trade.
Goldman Sachs investment banking revenue was $1.87 billion (up 20% YoY), supported by big increases in debt and equity underwriting revenue. Similarly, JPMorgan Chase reported a 31% YoY growth in its investment banking revenue to $2.27 billion. Bank of America reported 15% higher YoY investment banking fees to $1.44 billion, and Citigroup’s rose 44% to $999 million.
With a strong blend of stability, personal touch, and community focus that often exceeds what the big banks offer, regional banks have been the highlight of the Q3 bank earnings season.
The banking sector has started seeing strength in consumer activity, and this will amplify with more rate cuts. We believe regional banks are the biggest beneficiaries due to their historically cheaper valuation amidst persistent fears since the 2023 bank failures.
John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (NYSE:BTO), yielding 7.7%, is a closed-end fund that provides an income-focused investment and exposure to lucrative sectors within financial services. Just a few months ago, some of BTO’s largest holdings were alternative asset managers, and this has now shifted considerably in favor of high-quality regional banks to take advantage of the cheaper valuations and strengthening fundamentals from increased economic activity. Source
~98% of the CEF’s assets are invested in banking, capital markets, consumer finance, and insurance firms. BTO is deeply diversified across 192 companies, and its top 10 holdings only comprise ~16% of the assets.
BTO was born in 1994 with an IPO price of $20/share. Over the past 30 years, the CEF has experienced numerous economic events, but has done a terrific job maintaining and growing its NAV while giving generous distributions to shareholders.
The chart below demonstrates the difference between active and passive investments. Buying into the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) before the interest rate cuts would have you underwater after collecting all dividends.
It was a tough time for the banking sector, but BTO managed to extract the best from the situation, delivering steady distributions and allowing investors to reinvest sizeably into cheaper prices to participate in the recovery. Source
BTO distributes $0.65/share every quarter, with estimated sources of YTD payments being 19% ROC, 17% NII, and 64% capital gains. This indicates that the CEF has done an excellent job realizing gains from actively buying low and selling higher. BTO trades at par with NAV, in comparison to rich premiums in past years, presenting an opportunity to buy into this well-managed and time-tested CEF.
When it comes to wanting a simple but wide exposure to the financial sector, BTO provides a great avenue to be able to do that by letting the managers of the fund govern where you have exposure and the process of moving from one position to another based on the opportunity. You don’t need to be a banking expert to benefit from the financial sector’s ability to deliver essential liquidity to the economy and generate interest from loans, which in turn helps pay shareholders. Instead of merely covering your bank fees, fines and interest, consider having financial institutions reward you with cash back, allowing you to enjoy the thriving American economy. Whether it slows down in a recession or explodes back into life the next time we exit a recession, all along, financial institutions have a storied history of being able to provide strong income to their shareholders and to be able to consistently prove the naysayers wrong.
One day, I do believe that we will face a depression, but rarely does history repeat identically. Since regulations governing the financial sector are significantly stronger than they were in the 1930s, I expect that the depression would be caused by something else. And yes, it will have an impact on the banking sector, but I do not believe it will cause a widespread collapse like we saw previously. Regardless, I plan to collect wonderful income whether we have a depression or recession, an economic boom, or anything in between because that is what my Income Method is designed to do. That's the beauty of it and the beauty of income investing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731381-ueda-lifts-yen-stocks-slump-gilts-under-pressure-post-budget,4731381,"Ueda Lifts Yen, Stocks Slump, Gilts Under Pressure Post-Budget","The main move in the foreign exchange market today is the recovery of the yen following what was seen as hawkish comments by BOJ Governor Ueda. Otherwise, the tone is one of consolidation. The equity market sell-off today may be weighing on the Scandis and dollar bloc currencies amid risk-off impulses. Emerging market currencies are mixed. The Mexican peso, which fell to a new low for the year yesterday, is stabilizing today and is among the stronger emerging market currencies.
Only China's CSI 300 (SHSZ300) of the large markets in Asia-Pacific rose today, and Europe's STOXX 600 is off around 0.75%. If sustained, it will be the third consecutive decline. US index futures (SPX, SP500) are around 1% lower. The equity sell-off in Europe is not spurring a bid for bonds. Benchmark 10-year yields are 4-8 basis points higher, with UK Gilt yields rising most post-budget. The 10-year US Treasury yield (US10Y) is little changed near 4.29%. Gold set a record high slightly above $2990 but is now lower on the day. Oil is firm, but the gap created by Monday's lower opening in the December WTI contract extends to about $71.80 and has not been filled.
It was a busy day in the region. The Bank of Japan left policy on hold as widely expected, and the macro forecasts did not change much. Governor Ueda's comment that foreign exchange has a significant economic impact, understood to underscore his intent to hike rates, spurred a short squeeze, helping the yen recover. September retail sales fell by 2.3% after rising 1.0% in August. The median forecast was for a 0.3% pullback. September industrial output rose 1.4% after plummeting 3.3% in August. Although it was a little stronger than expected, Japan's industrial output still fell by 0.4% in Q3.
Australia reported a 0.1% rise, in September retail sales, softer than expected and below the average through August of 0.4%. Adjusted for inflation, retail sales rose by 0.5% in Q3 after falling by 0.3% in Q2. The RBA meets next week. And although Q3 inflation was softer than expected, the underlying measures are still hovering around 3.6-3.7%. Also, private credit expansion remains strong. There is no sense of urgency for the RBA to act.
For its part, China reported an uptick in its PMI. The manufacturing PMI rose for the second consecutive month and edged back above the 50 boom/bust level at 50.1. The non-manufacturing ticked up to 50.2 from 50.0. It has not been below 50 since the end of 2022. The composite rose to 50.8 to match a five-month high.
The dollar recorded an inside day yesterday against the Japanese yen. The US 10-year yield, which peaked on Tuesday near 4.34%, briefly dipped below 4.20% yesterday before the equity session began in North America. It recovered to around 4.28%, but the dollar remained better offered against the yen. The dollar stalled just in front of JPY153.50, where options for nearly $1.4 billion expire today. The greenback was sold in response to BOJ Governor Ueda's comments, and it briefly traded below JPY152 for the first time since Monday. There are about $1.4 billion in options that expire there today. It looks poised to recover toward JPY152.60-80. The Australian dollar posted an outside day, trading on both sides of Tuesday's range, but the technical signal was muted by the settlement within the range. The Australian dollar held below $0.6600. It is confined to a narrow range so far today, (~$0.6565-0.6580). The US dollar may have formed a bearish shooting star candlestick on Tuesday, and follow-through selling yesterday took the greenback to around CNH7.1280 and to nearly CNH7.1200 today. However, like the dollar is recovering from the dip below JPY152 against the yen, it is also recovering against the yuan. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1250 (CNY7.1390 yesterday).
The UK budget was largely as touted: increase in some taxes (GBP41 billion, or ~$53.3 billion), the most in a generation. Borrowing will also be lifted, and this saw the 10-year Gilt yield rise three basis points after having been down 10 bp before Reeve's budget speech. Still, the rise in Gilt yields was less than most eurozone bonds. While there is much that Labour stalwarts will favor, two elements may not sit well. First, Labour will end the freeze income thresholds and inflation also may spur bracket creep. Also, the fact that day-to-day public spending will increase by 1.5% may strike some as miserly after the Tories apparently had penciled in a 1% increase.
The eurozone reported a small acceleration in inflation. Consumer prices rose by 0.3% in October for a 2.0% year-over-year rate (from 1.7% in September). The three of the largest members of the bloc saw their EU-harmonized measures stay below 2%. Germany was the exception (2.4% vs. 1.8%). Meanwhile, the aggregate EMU unemployment rate was steady at 6.3% because the August series was revised lower to 6.3% The fact that eurozone's unemployment is at record lows is impressive given the sub-par growth.
The market has scaled back the odds of a 50 bp cut from the ECB in December to about 20% from a little more than 40% at the end of last week. At the same time, the market remains confident that the Bank of England will deliver a quarter-point cut next week. The odds of another cut in December have fallen below 20% from around 60% at the end of last week. Separately, we learned earlier this week that the Swedish economy contracted for the third consecutive quarter. After three quarter-point rate cuts since May, the swaps market is discounting about a 75% chance of a half-point move next week. Another 75 bp of cuts is expected in the following three meetings.
The euro made a marginal new high yesterday slightly above $1.0870 in the North American afternoon. This is the resistance area we noted, which also corresponds to the 200-day moving average. It is consolidating in a narrow 10-tick range around $1.0855. Options for 1.65 billion euros struck at $1.09 expire today, and another 1.3 billion euro options expire there tomorrow. The US two-year premium over Germany narrow by another seven basis points yesterday after narrowing by eight basis points on Tuesday. The premium, near 188 bp, is the least in a week. The volatility around the UK budget saw sterling trade in a little more than a one-cent range yesterday. It recovered from a four-day low near $1.2935 to a new session high slightly below $1.3045. Although sterling traded on both sides of Tuesday's range, the close was within the range. Yet, the inability to sustain a foothold above $1.30 was disappointing. It remains below there today, but is also holding above yesterday's low. Options for nearly GBP430 million at $1.29 and GBP370 million options at $1.30 expire today.
The September US personal income and consumption data were embedded in yesterday's Q3 GDP (2.8%). US Q3 GDP was a little softer than expected at 2.8%, but the consumption strengthened to 3.7% from 2.8%. This suggests the risk is to the upside of the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey for a 0.4% increase in the personal consumption (and/upward revisions).
The thunder from the deflators has been stolen by the CPI and PPI figures, which pointed to a small (~0.1%) decline in the year-over-year headline rate (to 2.1%) and core rate (to 2.6%). A 0.2% rise in the headline rate, month-over-month, would put the three-month annualized rate at 2.0%. Recall that it was less than 1% in Q4 '23, which may make for difficult comparisons this year. A 0.3% rise in the core PCE deflator last month would translate into a 2.6% annualized pace in Q3. In Q4 '23, it rose at an annualized pace of about 1.6%.
The Q3 Employment Cost Index also is on tap. It is the best measure of labor costs but does not incorporate productivity. The ECI is seen rising by 0.9%, the same as in Q2. If accurate, it would be the slowest increase in six months since H1 '21.
Tomorrow is the monthly employment report. The jump in ADP (233k) was twice as high much as expected and largely due to seasonal adjustments. It is the highest since last July, when ADP reported an increase of 307k private sector jobs. The BLS reported a 148k increase in private sector employment in July 2023. Canada reports August monthly GDP today. It has reported a stagnant month in Q1 (March) and Q2 (June).
The US dollar stalled yesterday a few hundreds of a Canadian dollar from the year's high set early August near CAD1.3945. It reversed and slipped slightly below CAD1.39. The greenback settled near its lows, but no important technical levels were taken out, including Tuesday's low (slightly below CAD1.3880). And the US dollar has come back bid, perhaps helped by the risk-off mood in the US equity market. It is pushing above CAD1.3920 in Europe. A move above CAD1.3940-45 could signal the next leg up toward CAD1.40. The Mexican peso buckled yesterday. It fell by more than 0.6% to a new two-year low. The US dollar rose to nearly MXN20.2280. The peso slid despite the stronger-than-expected Q3 GDP (1.0% quarter-over-quarter rather than the 0.6% expansion projected by the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey). Investors and economists do not expect the growth to be sustained. Latam currencies accounted for the five worst-performing emerging market currencies yesterday, led by the Chilean peso's 0.80% decline. The greenback failed to close above the previous high set in August (~MXN20.2180) and is consolidating at slightly lower levels near MXN20.15 in the Europe.

Moreover, we have seen important developments in the industry over the last few weeks, especially with the $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium (ALTM) by Rio Tinto (RIO).
Although we have seen production cut announcements from some producers, the world's supply of lithium is expected to grow by almost 150% over the next 4 years, according to S&P Global (SPGI).
Even though the global lithium demand remains in a structural uptrend, the adoption of electric vehicles in certain regions of the world has been slower than what was expected a few years ago, and this is especially true in the North American market.
Over the years, I have been involved in the coal, uranium and natural gas industries, among others. From experience, I know that commodity prices can remain well below the marginal cost of production for a much longer period than what I can expect.
After a vicious decline in lithium prices, the sentiment has become pretty negative in the industry. Among many other players, Li-FT Power (TSXV:LIFT:CA) was subject to heavy selling during the summer of 2024, and it is why I decided to do some research on the name.
After more than 50,000 meters of drilling in less than two years, Li-FT Power is expected to release a preliminary economic assessment on its Yellowknife project in the coming months. Based on my current understanding of the project, I will pay close attention to the transportation cost assumptions that will be used, as I believe it could make or break the profitability of the project.
The management team has delivered solid execution with the various drilling programs completed so far, and the project has advanced at a rapid pace since its acquisition in 2022.
The current market capitalization of almost CAD$160 million is underpinned by a project that released its first resource estimate just a few days ago. My hold rating is reflective of the large gap between the market cap and the advancement stage of the Yellowknife project. Indeed, it is still very early days for Li-FT Power.
After a super-charged rally in 2021, the slump in lithium and other battery metals has been equally brutal. Lithium carbonate prices have fallen by over 80% from their historic high of $80,000 per metric ton, and at the end of the third quarter of 2024, lithium carbonate prices were hovering around $11,400 per metric ton. Whether it is in North America or in Asia, the lithium market is in oversupply conditions, as the production associated with the important capital investments made over the last few years is now showing up.
The growth continues to be robust on the demand front, as the market for lithium-ion batteries is expected to reach the 1.0 terawatt threshold in 2024. The electric vehicle market continues to dictate overall demand, as it represented approximately 80% of total lithium-ion battery demand in 2023. On average, the battery pack of an electric vehicle represents between 25% and 30% of the total cost, and the cathode is the most cost-sensitive part of the battery. In other words, lithium carbonate prices can drastically alter the economics of producing electric vehicles, and ultimately, it can alter consumers' behaviours.
Although the lithium industry is facing serious challenges at the moment, the structural demand trends are still intact. Electric vehicle sales have been lower than expected in multiple markets, but in the long run, the global trend toward electrification remains in play.
Typical of almost every commodity cycle, the best cure for low prices is low prices, as it encourages demand and puts producers with elevated production costs out of business. In my view, the most bullish thing we could see for long-term lithium prices would be another leg down in prices. I do not know where lithium prices are going in the short term, but the lower they go, the more bullish I will become.
I was introduced to the lithium market in 2018 when studying Neo Lithium, which was developing the 3Q Project in the Catamarca region of Argentina. The deposit is located at the southern end of the Lithium Triangle and is now owned by Zijin Mining (OTCPK:ZIJMF) following the CAD$960 million acquisition of Neo Lithium announced in October 2021.
Of note, Altius Minerals (ALS:CA) that I covered in a previous article owns a 0.1% gross sales royalty on the 3Q deposit. The company is also a significant shareholder of Lithium Royalty (LIRC:CA), which owns a 1% gross sales royalty on the project. The deposit has one of the highest-grade lithium brine reserves in the world, and I remember being impressed by the 40% IRR and the 50-year mine life announced in the feasibility study published in October 2021. What was even more impressive at the time was the lithium carbonate price assumption of $12,300 per metric ton. When looking at Li-FT Power today, it feels like the lithium market is in a completely different world.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the Lithium Triangle produced 268,716 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2023, which is equal to roughly 27% of global supply. By 2028, supply from the region is projected to grow by approximately 135% and surpass 630,000 metric tons. If this growth materializes, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile would become the largest contributors to global lithium supply growth over the next 5 years.
Using a lithium carbonate price of approximately $14,000, the charts below indicate that a significant portion of the world's production is still profitable. When it comes to production costs, brine producers have a definitive advantage over hard-rock deposits. From that perspective, it is not surprising that we have seen some production cut announcements coming from hard-rock producers in Australia, among others.
LI-FT Power is a TSXV-listed lithium pegmatite exploration company with two properties in the Northwest Territories and three in Quebec. The company's flagship asset is the Yellowknife Lithium Project located in the Northwest Territories, approximately 50 kilometres away from the town of Yellowknife.
In October 2024, Li-FT Power published an initial mineral resource estimate of 50.4 million tonnes of inferred material grading 1.0% in lithium oxide. After the completion of approximately 50,000 meters of drilling since the spring of 2023, the Yellowknife Lithium Project is now the third largest hard-rock project in Canada and the tenth largest in the Western Hemisphere.
Considering the advancement stage of the Cali Project and of the exploration properties in Québec, it is the Yellowknife Lithium Project that truly underpins the current market capitalization of around CAD$160 million. The second-largest asset owned by the company is the Rupert property, made up of a little over 140,000 hectares of prospective ground in the James Bay Region in Québec.
The Yellowknife property is composed of 13 mineral leases owned through the wholly owned subsidiary Erex International. Of note, the property is subject to an underlying net smelter return royalty of 2.0%, on top of an overriding gross production royalty of 2.0%.
Li-FT Power acquired the asset in November 2022 by issuing 18.0 million shares to the seller. At today's share price of approximately CAD$3.44, the transaction would be worth around CAD$62.0 million. In June 2023, the company launched its first drilling program on the property, and despite having issues with forest fires, approximately 34,200 meters of drilling was completed. To build on those results, Li-FT power followed up with an 18,600-meter drilling program in January 2024. The first tangible result of those two drilling programs was the initial resource estimate published in October 2024.
For its fiscal year ending November 30, 2023, Li-FT Power spent CAD$36.2 million in exploration and other evaluation expenditures. For the first nine months of 2024, the exploration and other evaluation expenditures totaled CAD$20.6 million. If we include the purchase price consideration of 18.0 million shares worth approximately CAD$62.0 million at today's share price, we can see that Li-FT Power has a cost basis of around CAD$120.0 million, which compares to the current market capitalization of around CAD$160 million. The premium over the cost basis can be explained in part by the land package in Québec, the Cali Project in the Northwest Territories, and the global advancement of the Yellowknife project since its acquisition two years ago.
At the end of October 2024, Li-FT Power announced a CAD$21.3 million private placement consisting of 2.7 million flow-through shares at a price of CAD$5.66, and 1.6 million common shares at a hard dollar price of CAD$3.65. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur on or before November 12, 2024. One single strategic investor is expected to purchase all of the common shares to be issued under the offering.
This capital infusion will allow Li-FT Power to move forward in its timeline. The next important milestone is the publication of a preliminary economic assessment, expected in April or May 2025. The drilling program for the summer of 2025 should start a few weeks after, and last until approximately the end of August. Based on this game plan, Li-Power is likely to require another capital infusion before the winter drilling program of 2026. It is in large part the results of the preliminary economic assessment and of the various drilling programs that will dictate the cost of capital for the next capital raise.
The resource exploration business is speculative and capital-intensive in nature. There is no certainty that the important expenditures made by LIFT will result in discoveries of commercial quantities of minerals. The Yellowknife Project is still in the early stage of development, as the first preliminary economic assessment is expected in the spring of 2025.
Li-FT Power does not generate any revenues or cash flows at the moment, and it could remain that way for multiple years, as it is still way too early to even talk about production. Although the strategic investment of CAD$21.6 million announced in the last few days is indicative of healthy access to capital, the company does not control the results of its upcoming programs, and the same could be said about the future state of the global lithium industry.
At the start of an upcycle, exploration companies like Li-FT Power are generally the last ones to move, as the capital flows must trickle down across the entire industry before reaching the junior explorers.
Large producers like Albemarle (ALB) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) would obviously be the first ones to benefit from a recovery in lithium prices. Small producers like Sigma Lithium (SGML) would come next on the list, followed by developers like Lithium Americas (LAC). Junior exploration companies like Li-FT Power, Standard Lithium (SLI) or Patriot Battery Metals (PMET:CA) come at the very end. Over a long enough time horizon, most junior exploration companies will slowly decay toward zero as the constant dilution takes its toll. As discussed in previous articles, it is directly comparable to the time decay of an out-of-the-money call option with an expiration date of a few years.
The market's reaction to the upcoming preliminary economic assessment and drilling programs will be a key determining factor when it comes to the cost of capital. Disappointing results or worsening sentiment in the global lithium industry could impair the company's ability to raise capital and advance its projects.
The Yellowknife Project is characterized by multiple lithium pegmatite outcrops, which are clearly visible from satellite imagery. The lithium oxide grade of approximately 1.0% is typical for hard-rock lithium deposits. In a way, we could almost talk about quarry operations for the project, as the ore sits right at the surface.
Even though there is rail access in Hay River, millions of metric tons of spodumene would need to be transported by barge first. Afterward, the spodumene would then need to be transported by rail for over a thousand kilometres before reaching the port of either Vancouver or Prince Rupert.
In my view, the cost of transportation to reach global markets is a key element that could either make or break the economics of the project. This factor is particularly important given the nature of hard-rock lithium mines. I view lithium spodumene as a form of bulk commodity, similar to potash or iron ore for example, as the same kind of infrastructure is required.
I am attracted by the simplicity of the project, although I have many concerns about access to global markets. Given the current market capitalization of almost CAD$160 million and the fact that a preliminary economic assessment is still a few months away, it is too early for me to dip my toes. Considering the important risks involved and the early stage of the project, I would at least need a significant margin of safety before doing so.
The strategic investment recently announced is an important development for the company. I view the CAD$3.65 issue price as a key indication of fair value, and the lower the share price goes below that threshold, the larger my interest in the company will become.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730995-dividend-wins-3-great-picks-to-fuel-growth-and-beat-inflation,4730995,Dividend Wins: 3 Great Picks To Fuel Growth And Beat Inflation,"The quote above is from a lengthy report from the European Investment Bank, which looked into the impact of uncertainty on investment decisions. Essentially, it means that the higher the uncertainty, the more reluctant companies are to put money to work. This is bad for economic growth, as our economies rely on investments in growth.
After being active on the stock market for more than 13 years, I think it's fair to say the same applies to investing in stocks and other financial products. If I had gotten a dollar every time someone said they felt there was too much certainty to put money to work, I would probably be a co-owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
All kidding aside, the thing about uncertainty is that there is always something going on that could potentially be a reason to sell stocks. When I was a Corporate Treasury intern at a large German consumer/industrial conglomerate, we had weekly meetings discussing major currency pairs and macroeconomic/geopolitical drivers that could potentially impact the business.
Back in 2019, almost every meeting was about the impact of Brexit, which makes sense, as business and market participants always focus on the biggest perceived risks, which impact financial decisions. The worst part about this is that there's always something to worry about.
As we can see in the S&P 500 chart above (2009-2021), the market has been through a lot. The list below shows some of the issues investors had to deal with.
Although investors who anticipated some of the headwinds above were able to beat the market, every long-term investor who bought the market at any point in history has made a smart decision, as proven by the fact that the market trades at an all-time high.
With that said, I am not advocating for random investing in stocks just because ""stocks go up in the long run."" Unless you're investing in some of the market's best ETFs (like SPY/VOO and SCHD), it never hurts to incorporate certain themes in a portfolio.
In today's market, the biggest factors are inflation risks and economic stability. For example, the market has priced in five more 25-basis point Fed rate cuts over the next 10 months. This is only possible if inflation comes down further.
If inflation does not continue its downtrend, the Fed may have to keep rates higher for longer, potentially resulting in investors having to adjust their models.
The worst part about predicting what the Fed may be up to is the fact that inflation and economic growth are subject to countless variables. One of them is the situation in the nation's capital.
According to Jonathan Levin, traders are already starting to price in higher inflation, potentially related to rapidly rising odds that former President Trump could win the election. Although it needs to be seen what a Trump 2.0 presidency will look like (if he wins, of course), the market believes that aggressive tariffs could be a reason for inflation to rebound. This also applies to potential mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.
On a side note, don't shoot the messenger, I'm just reporting here. I don't care who you vote for, and I'm certainly now writing any of this to influence people.
According to The Wall Street Journal, economists expect inflation under Trump to rise faster than under Harris. However, both have inflationary plans.
Regardless of what economists think, the market has priced in higher inflation. They are not hinting at a disaster, but the trend is in the wrong direction.
Objectively speaking, this could mean two things:
Then there's economic growth.
While Trump may be inflationary, the consensus is that he's much better for the economy. As reported by The Hill, President Trump leads Vice President Harris by 18 points on economic issues.
Theoretically, a Trump 2.0 scenario could be higher inflation and higher growth, a mix that could be beneficial. A Harris 1.0 scenario could consist of subdued inflation and slower growth. This, too, could be great for some asset classes.
Personally, I have no idea what will happen. I'm not even sure who's going to win, as I wrote in a recent article.
Hence, I do what I always do. In order to reduce uncertainty, I focus on companies that can deliver no matter what. Stocks that let me sleep well at night and allow me to put money to work without wondering if I just made a horrible financial mistake.
In this case, I'll focus on economic resilience and pricing power, two factors I expect to be key for the next few years, as inflation and growth will remain two drivers of uncertainty.
This brings me to the first pick.
In-depth research
Waste Management is the only pick in this article that does not have a very attractive valuation. However, I still wanted to include the stock, as it offers what I consider to be the perfect mix of safety, inflation protection, and safety.
Waste Management is a critical part of the North American economy, as it takes care of waste through hundreds of landfills, transfer facilities, collection sites, and renewable energy facilities.
Waste is a wonderful place to be, as getting rid of it is essential. Luckily for the company and its peers, waste is everywhere, as almost every economic process imaginable creates waste.
This provides at least three tailwinds for long-term success, as I wrote in my most recent in-depth article:
While Waste Management is not a fancy tech company, the mix of secular growth, inflation protection, and anti-cyclical demand has allowed it to return 428% over the past ten years.
This consistency has also supported its dividend. Although its current yield of 1.4% is nothing to write home about, it comes with a five-year CAGR of 8.1% and a track record of 20 consecutive annual hikes.
Even better, the company is firing on all cylinders. In its just-released third quarter, the company reported 7.9% higher revenues, beating expectations due to higher market prices for recyclable commodities.
Moreover, after growing margins by 90 basis points, it reached a record EBITDA margin of 30.5%.
As I have written in prior articles, labor, and material-intensive waste management companies have a lot of room to cut costs by using new technologies and whatnot. In 3Q24, the company reported a 70-basis-point improvement in operating expenses, which now stand at 60.6% of revenue. This marks four consecutive quarters of cost reduction below 61.0%.
The takeover of Stericycle is also progressing, which adds a whole new portfolio of medical-waste-focused assets in North America and Europe. This market is expected to see between 13-17% annual EBITDA growth. WM bought the company for 13x EBITDA, which is a great deal.
The company also continues to improve its recycling capabilities with the completion of eight projects during the third quarter, including six automation upgrades and two new facilities in New York and Florida. According to the company, these upgrades are part of a 39-project growth program that has increased WM's annual recycling capacity by 1.5 million tons.
On that note, by the end of this year, the company expects to have seven of its 20 renewable natural gas projects online, turning waste into energy.
Valuation-wise, the company is expected to grow its EPS by 17% this year, potentially followed by 11% in both 2025 and 2026, respectively.
Applying its 10-year average P/E ratio of 25.1x, we get a fair stock price of $223, 1% above the current price ($220).
While I am bullish, I hope we get a correction, as I believe WM is a great addition to every dividend portfolio, except the ones that completely rely on high-dividend stocks.
In-depth research
When I wrote the article above, Kinder Morgan yielded 6.3%. Since then, it has returned 38%, beating the S&P 500 by roughly 27 points. Currently, KMI yields 4.6%, which is still a good deal.
Just like Waste Management, Kinder Morgan is ""mission critical."" And just like Waste Management, its business model is less cyclical than the business models of its customers.
Kinder Morgan is a midstream company, which means it owns the assets that allow oil and gas producers to ship their products from Point A to Point B. As we can see below, it owns 66 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, servicing roughly 40% of U.S. natural gas production. It also owns massive storage facilities (15% of U.S. natural gas capacity), export facilities, Jones Act vessels, crude oil pipelines, and CO2 pipelines.
The company generates most of its cash flow (68%) from take-or-pay/hedged contracts. This means its exposure to energy commodity prices is minimal. As we can see below, just 5% of its cash flow is subject to commodity price changes.
Moreover, most of its contracts come with inflation protection.
Although KMI has cut its dividend in the past eight years, it has grown its adjusted EPS by 8% per year since 2016. During this period, it has lowered its leverage from 5.3x to 3.9x EBITDA and returned $20.3 billion to shareholders, 37% of its current market cap.
Looking ahead, Kinder Morgan expects strong demand growth for natural gas, fueled by LNG exports, demand from Mexico, and the rising need for electricity generation from AI-related data center additions.
As a result of rising demand, the company added $450 million to its project backlog during the third quarter, bringing the total to $5.2 billion.
These additions include the Gulf Coast Express expansion, new storage facilities, and a natural gas power plant lateral. Moreover, over $500 million worth of new projects were placed into service.
With regard to its dividend, KMI currently yields 4.6%. This dividend has a five-year CAGR of 5.8%. Although the company lost a lot of trust when it cut its dividend in the past, I do not expect that to happen again, as KMI is much stronger than at any point in its history.
With regard to its valuation, I believe the stock should not trade below 10x operating cash flow (""OCF""). Currently, it trades at a blended P/OCF ratio of 9.3x. In 2025 and 2026, analysts expect 7% and 1% per-share OCF growth.
Conservatively speaking, I believe KMI has the potential to return 10-14% per year, regardless of inflation, economic growth, and who's the next president.
In-depth research
Generally speaking, there are two sectors that are perfect for periods of elevated inflation. As we can see below, these sectors are energy and real estate.
Historically, these sectors have the highest probability of beating the market in times of above-average inflation.
In real estate, I like companies that bring something special to the table, as obvious as that may sound. This includes manufactured housing (""MH"") communities.
That's where Sun Communities comes in. With a market cap of $17 billion, it's the largest North American owner of MH communities. On top of that, it also generates money from RV communities, marinas, and holiday parks in the United Kingdom. In fact, ""traditional"" MH communities account for just 45% of total revenue.
As we can see below, the company owns almost 290 MH communities in the U.S. alone. These parks have close to 100 thousand sites and are roughly 97% occupied. It also has 33 thousand RV sites in North America, including Sun Retreats Rock River in Illinois, which is an all-ages park that allows pets and is located close to attractions like zoos.
Roughly 89% of its net operating income comes from real property (rents). The remaining 11% are generated from home sales and service, retail, dining, and entertainment operations.
I love this business model for a number of reasons, including the fact that it is rather easy to scale. Sun Communities maintains communities that attract a wide variety of tenants. These people pay lot fees in exchange for the usage of amenities and the benefits that come with MH and RV communities.
Even better is the fact that demand has secular growth drivers.
Looking at the data below, the company has a low occupancy turnover and an average resident tenure of roughly 16 years. When adding that most retirees have stable incomes (with inflation protection), SUI is in a fantastic spot.
I also need to add that the supply of MH communities is low. Almost no new communities are being built, pressured by ""not in my backyard"" concerns. This, too, benefits pricing.
As a result, since 2000, SUI has grown its same-store net operating income by 5.2% per year, 210 basis points above the multifamily REIT average. Even better, no recession over the past 24 years was able to damage net operating income.
This has supported its dividend.
Currently, SUI yields 2.9%. This dividend has a very low payout ratio of 62% and a five-year CAGR of 4.9%. Over the past seven years, the company has consistently grown its dividend, using the ten years before that to expand its business and increase future growth capabilities.
It also has a healthy balance sheet. Looking at the data below, the company has an investment grade credit rating of BBB/Baa3 from S&P Global and Moody's, a well-laddered maturity schedule, mostly unencumbered assets, and a net leverage ratio of 6.0x.
Valuation-wise, analysts expect a per-share adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO"") recovery in 2025 and 2026, with 7% growth in both years. Moreover, the company trades at 21.3x, a few points below its 10-year average of 24.8x.
While it may take a path to lower interest rates to unlock a higher multiple, I believe SUI has a fair stock price target of $175, 34% above the current price.
All things considered, I am bullish on both SUI and its peer, Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS), believing they are among the most underappreciated REITs on the market. Although they do not yield 5% or 6%, their business models are fantastic, putting them in a great spot to keep beating the market.
In a world filled with uncertainty, I've learned that chasing certainty before investing is a losing game.
Market challenges are always with us, including inflation worries and global economic shifts. However, these cycles don't need to derail a solid investment approach.
Hence, my strategy focuses on resilience and growth potential, with an emphasis on companies built to withstand and even thrive in challenging times.
With investments like Waste Management, Kinder Morgan, and Sun Communities, I'm focusing on companies with essential business models that offer inflation protection.
They also offer income growth and reliability, which are qualities that keep me confident in their ability to beat the market over time.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731364-cqqq-investors-waiting-more-stimulus-rating-upgrade,4731364,CQQQ: Investors Are Waiting For More Stimulus (Rating Upgrade),"Throughout my coverage of the Chinese stock market on Seeking Alpha, I repeatedly mentioned the key thing about Chinese equities: it's all about proper market timing. The latest rally has once again confirmed this thesis. Another wave of growth in Chinese stocks will largely depend on new stimulus measures, and it seems that Chinese authorities are preparing a new fiscal package.
I'm still cautious about the outlook for China and Chinese equities in particular, but I also remain constructive about the possibility of further growth of Chinese stocks amid a potential new influx of financial liquidity. I'm upgrading the Invesco China Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:CQQQ) to ""Hold"" and will continue to closely follow the developments in the Chinese economy.
The CQQQ ETF offers slightly different exposure to the Chinese stock market compared to other China-related ETFs. For example, unlike the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), the CQQQ ETF doesn't have Alibaba (BABA) among its fund holdings at all. Instead, the CQQQ has companies like Meituan (OTCPK:MPNGF) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) among its top holdings.
At the same time, the CQQQ has plenty of less-known Chinese companies in its portfolio, like the software firm Kuaishou Technology (OTCPK:KUASF).
In February, I initiated coverage of the CQQQ ETF with a ""Buy"" rating. I anticipated that more stimulus would drive Chinese stocks higher at some point. Since then, the CQQQ went up by almost 31% YTD, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index.
However, in late July, I downgraded the CQQQ to ""Sell"", amid the underwhelming performance of the Chinese economy and worsening geopolitical outlook.
Soon after that, the Chinese authorities announced a huge stimulus package, which led to the fastest rally in Chinese stocks in many years. Was my rating downgrade a mistake? Given that there was no clear indication that China could announce another stimulus ""bazooka"", Chinese stocks could stagnate for many more quarters without growth divers. In this regard, I wouldn't say that the downgrade was a wrong move.
China’s economic situation remains tough, to say the least. According to the latest data, China’s GDP growth in Q3 2024 was 4.6% year-on-year, below expectations.
Additionally, the property market remains a weak spot. Home prices have been falling at their fastest rate since 2015, indicating low consumer confidence and deteriorating household wealth.
For the technology sector, which relies on consumer demand and robust economic growth, these economic weaknesses could weigh on earnings. Companies like Meituan (OTCPK:MPNGF), PDD (PDD), and Kuaishou (KUASF), all of which depend on discretionary spending, could be especially vulnerable if consumer sentiment remains subdued.
Given the state of the economy, more stimulus is crucial for China to stay afloat economically. Rumors say that a new, multi-year $1.4 trillion stimulus package is being prepared by Chinese authorities, which would include measures to help local governments manage debt and fund infrastructure projects. However, without targeted support for consumer spending, this stimulus might not reach sectors like technology that rely on domestic demand.
The upcoming U.S. elections could add to the volatility in Chinese stocks. If Donald Trump wins, his stance on China is expected to be more aggressive, with extremely high tariffs on Chinese goods and chip-related trade restrictions. Kamala Harris, while maintaining a tough stance, might avoid direct trade wars and imposing harsh tariffs. In my view, either outcome is likely to create some level of market stress for Chinese stocks, especially those listed in the U.S. or with substantial international business.
What's interesting is that Chinese stocks dropped more during Biden's presidency, which may also indicate that the outlook for Chinese equities may not turn out to be better in the case of Harris' win.
For CQQQ, which holds domestically listed companies, the impact of U.S. policy could be less severe than for Chinese companies with ADRs. Yet, increased tariffs or a stronger U.S. dollar could weaken China’s economy, indirectly affecting the domestic tech sector.
Even though China and the US will likely clash in another round of a trade war next year, the recent rally in Chinese equities clearly showed that Chinese equities react to monetary and fiscal stimulus way more aggressively than to geopolitical actions, at least so far. Chinese leaders seem to have realized that it wouldn't be possible to sustain any meaningful growth rates without more active support of the economy.
Also, if Trump wins the US presidential elections, there's a chance that another round of geopolitical escalation can turn out to be an attempt to strike some form of a trade deal, which could temporarily relieve stress between the two countries. Thus, it makes sense to keep holding Chinese stocks and the CQQQ specifically if you're comfortable with the risks.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731329-golub-capital-stock-good-blend-of-yield-quality-and-income-in-expensive-sector,4731329,"Golub Capital: A Good Blend Of Yield, Quality, And Income In An Expensive Sector","This article was co-produced with The Dividend Collectuh.
With many Business Development Companies (BDCs) trading at high valuations above their net asset values, and the overall market continuing to trend higher, there seems to be limited opportunities to buy quality dividend stocks at a discount, or even a good price.
Most know quality usually comes at a premium, but scouring the 11 sectors, most trade at nosebleed valuations. Golub Capital BDC (NASDAQ:GBDC) currently sports a 10% yield that is well-covered by their income.
In this article, I discuss their latest earnings, and why the BDC remains a smart, attractive income play in the current market.
Since last covering Golub Capital BDC back in June, their share price has remained somewhat rangebound, down slightly over 3% while the S&P is up more than 7% over the same period. Experiencing a pullback, I thought GBDC was an attractive income play with the premium gap closing.


They had robust liquidity, strong dividend coverage, and were attractively priced in comparison to other quality peers like Capital Southwest (CSWC) and Main Street Capital (MAIN).
And despite the pullback, they saw double-digit growth from the previous year on their top and bottom lines. They also offered solid upside to their Wall Street price target of $17.25 during that time.
During Q3 earnings back in August, it was apparent of Golub Capital's benefits of the merger with GBDC III. The merger closed this past June, and net investment income saw a $0.04 increase from the previous year's quarter from $0.44. Total investment income of $171.27 million grew double-digits from $154.72 million in Q3'23.
This also saw solid growth of 4.3% from the previous quarter, while net investment income saw a $0.03 drop over the same period. During the quarter, the BDC saw realized and unrealized losses of $0.17, primarily from two investments that negatively impacted their bottom line.
But not to be overshadowed by the negative aspects of the portfolio, the merger close provided several positive benefits. First, management permanently reduced their incentive fee from 20% to 15%, which will likely impact their bottom line positively going forward.
So, over the past year, management has permanently reduced their base management fee from 1.375% to 1% as well as their incentive fee. Additionally, the merger was highly accretive to their NAV.
This increased $0.20 from the previous quarter and from $14.83 in Q3'23 to $15.32. And thirdly, GBDC saw significantly higher transaction activity, with $435 million in investment commitments. This was in comparison to just $111 million in the previous year's quarter.
With the merger complete, GBDC's portfolio fair value stood at $7.9 billion at the end of Q3. They also saw their higher rated investments 4 & 5, five being the highest and 1 the lowest, tick up to 89.2% from 87.2% in the previous quarter.
I typically like to see a higher number, preferably above 90%. But the BDC's well-laddered debt, high first-lien exposure, and merger-related benefits still make them a solid income investment. But in future quarters, I would like to see this number increase above 90%.
The BDC also has a high concentration in first-lien loans at 93%, significantly higher than the BDC average of 79%. Additionally, their portfolio was highly diversified as their largest borrowers only accounted for 1.7% of their total portfolio and the top 10 only representing 14%.


Furthermore, leverage also saw a decrease to 1.05x, down from 1.15x in Q2. This is below the sector average and two of their high-quality peers Ares Capital (ARCC) and Blackstone Secured Lending (BXSL), who had leverages of 1.06x and 1.13x respectively.
From a debt standpoint, GBDC's balance sheet was in good shape to continue taking advantage of the likelihood of increased investment activity. The company sports an investment-grade credit rating from all 3 major agencies and has no debt maturing until 2026. Total debt stood at roughly $5.8 billion, and their liquidity was robust with $1.6 billion available.


While non-accruals increased slightly to roughly 1% and remain a risk going forward, Golub Capital's non-performing loans have been kept to a minimum, a further testament to their underwriting and overall portfolio quality. Furthermore, non-accruals actually saw a decrease from 1.5% at fair value in the previous year's quarter.


These also were well-below the peer averages of 1.2% and 2.5% respectively. To put this more into perspective, this is how GBDC stacked up against some of its peers in terms of non-accruals at fair value and cost:
And if Golub's portfolio credit quality and investment-grade balance sheet aren't enough, their double-digit yield remained well-covered despite the decline in net investment income, with base coverage of 124% during the quarter.
Management declared a supplemental of $0.05 for the upcoming December quarter, bringing the total payout to $0.44. This gives the BDC a cushion should NII become negatively impacted for unforeseen reasons.
Analysts' expectations are a decline in NII to $0.44, likely due to management's plan to work through the restructuring with borrowers Imperial Optical & Pluralsight. And although this would still give GBDC 100% coverage, I expect net investment income in a range of $0.44 - $0.50 due to merger benefits.
At the time of writing, Golub Capital BDC trades roughly in-line with their NAV price at $15.27 and above their average discount of 3.36%. And while I see little to no upside due to the expectation the FED will continue to lower rates, the 10% yield makes GBDC worth buying, as well as them being attractively priced vs some peers.
TSLX's current price-to-NAV sits at 1.19x, while PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT) also trades at a slight discount with a P/NAV ratio of 0.99x.
Additionally, investors are likely worried about the two additional companies added to non-accrual status, so the stock many experience some volatility should these rise in the upcoming quarter at the end of November.
Golub Capital BDC saw a decline year-over-year in their non-accruals, but in the quarter saw two additional companies added, bringing the total to 10. One of the non-performing loans experienced an unsuccessful sale during the quarter, which led to GBDC pivoting to restructure the loan.
Going forward, investors should keep an eye on these two borrowers as well as a rise in payment-in-kind income. This accounted for only 5.9% of GBDC's total investment income in Q3, but this could rise if borrowers become further impacted by macro environmental challenges.


Golub Capital BDC remains a high-quality investment despite the slight increase in non-accruals during Q3 earnings.
Additionally, the BDC stands to benefit over the longer-term due to merger-related benefits such as the permanent reduction in their base management and incentive fee over the past couple of quarters.
And while analysts expect dividend coverage to become tighter in the upcoming quarter, I suspect GBDC can see higher net investment income as a result of increased investment activity, as seen in their most recent quarter.
Furthermore, management can elect to eliminate the supplemental dividend of $0.05 going forward should their bottom line become negatively impacted in the quarters ahead, ensuring the dividend will likely remain safe for the near to medium-term.
Due to the BDC being attractively priced in comparison to some peers, as well as their strong, investment-rated balance sheet with well-staggered debt and robust liquidity, Golub Capital BDC remains an attractive income play in an expensive sector.

Starbucks (SBUX) plans to get back to the neighborhood coffeehouse vibe. (00:23) Blackstone (BX) is bidder for $7B investment in Rogers (RCI) wireless backhaul network - report. (01:59) Grammys end their +50 year stint with CBS, 'Music's Biggest Night' comes to Disney (DIS). (02:46)
This is an abridged transcript of the podcast.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) outlined some of the traffic headwinds it saw in the U.S., China, and other global markets during the company's earnings call. The company suspended its guidance for FY25, but said it still sees store growth opportunities because new stores in low-density regions are outperforming.
CEO Brian Niccol made his highly anticipated appearance on the call. Niccol said the earnings results were very disappointing. He wants Starbucks (SBUX) stores to be a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and where the company serves the finest coffee handcrafted by skilled baristas. A top priority is to improve the time it takes for store customers to receive their orders.
As part of an appeal to the coffeehouse vibe, Niccol said Starbucks (SBUX) plans to bring back condiment coffee bars in all cafes by early 2025, offer ceramic mugs again, and bring back more comfortable seating and amenities to make stores a place where customers want to gather.
An area that Starbucks (SBUX) plans to put in some guardrails is with order customization, as part of a strategy to improve through-put. The company is also removing extra charges for non-dairy milk orders, beginning on November 7.
Outside the U.S., Niccol noted the China turnaround could take some time, but was optimistic about the opportunities in new international markets.
Notably, Starbucks (SBUX) said it would not raise prices in North America in FY25.
The new strategy at Starbucks (SBUX) could have implications for rivals such as Dunkin' Donuts, Dutch Bros. (BROS), and Panera.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) is the mystery investor who bid for a $7 billion minority stake in Roger Communication Inc.'s (RCI) cell phone infrastructure business.
This is according to a Globe & Mail report on Wednesday, which cited two people familiar with the matter.
Rogers (RCI) announced last Thursday that it was selling a $7 billion equity interest in its backhaul network, though it didn't identify who the buyer was.
Rogers (RCI) offered Blackstone (BX), Apollo (APO) and a number of other large asset managers an opportunity to invest in the business, according to the report. Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) and KKR & Co. (KKR) also made pitches.
According to the report, Blackstone (BX) offered the best terms, though Apollo (APO) still wants the asset and is attempting to sweeten its offer.
The Grammys, hosted by The Recording Academy, have found a new broadcast partner after staying over half a century with CBS.
In a company blog, Disney (NYSE:DIS) said it has struck a 10-year global deal to the coveted event that will be exclusively simulcast on ABC, Hulu, and Disney+ beginning in 2027. The deal value was initially not disclosed, but according to a Wall Street Journal report, the company is paying more than $500 million to air the event.
As part of the deal, The Recording Academy will produce multiple Grammy-branded music specials and additional new programming for audiences around the world across Disney’s platforms, the company said.
The latest deal will set Disney up well in 2027 to broadcast The Oscars and Super Bowl LXI along with The Grammys.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731361-vanadium-miners-news-for-the-month-of-october-2024,4731361,Vanadium Miners News For The Month Of October 2024,"Welcome to the Vanadium miners news.
October saw vanadium pentoxide prices and ferrovanadium prices generally flat, with some small recovery in China.
Vanadium is traditionally used to harden steel. Chinese rebar standards are requiring more vanadium. Also, Vanadium Flow Batteries [VRFBs] are becoming increasingly popular, especially for commercial energy storage, most notably in China. Vanadium Pentoxide [V2O5] is used in VRFBs and Ferrovanadium [FeV] is used in the steel industry.
Europe & China Vanadium Pentoxide [V2O5] Flake 98% one year price chart (to Oct. 8, 2024) - Europe = USD 4.60/lb, China = USD 4.67/lb


Europe and China Ferrovanadium [FeV] 80% one year price chart (to Oct. 8, 2024) - Europe = USD 24.55/kg, China = USD 25.75/kg


In 2017 Robert Friedland stated: ""We think there's a revolution coming in vanadium redox flow batteries....""

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731359-sterling-infrastructure-plenty-of-growth-ahead-in-ai-data-centers-and-big-transportation-projects,4731359,Sterling Infrastructure: Plenty Of Growth Ahead In AI Data Centers And Big Transportation Projects,"Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL) has seen its share price take off in the past two years, outpacing the S&P 500 by over 400%.
Many investors believe this is due to the strategic positioning of the company within the booming data center infrastructure sector. And, to be honest, I agree, up to a certain extent. However, one can't overlook the excellent performance of the company within the transportation segment.
With Q3 2024 earnings set to be released in less than a week, shareholders will be paying close attention to some factors that I discuss in this article.
Among them is the strategic shift in the e-infrastructure segment towards highly lucrative data center infrastructure projects. In Q2 alone, revenue from data centers increased by 100% YoY.
Additionally, I recommend keeping a close eye on the evolution of capital expenditures, particularly in the transportation segment, as these investments have been pressuring free cash flows this year.
I will provide below the rationale behind my Strong Buy rating, including a valuation analysis and a risk section where I discuss the main risk to my bull thesis.
In the past two years, the company has outperformed the S&P 500 by 425%.
Adding a chart to compare this stock's return with its sector, industry, and the S&P 500 isn’t useful since they all appear mostly flat. A better comparison would be with its peers.
Looking at the latest 14A, I was able to identify a list of what the company believes is their peer group.


Please note that I chose only 5 companies from the list above for the comparison analysis.


In the past 2 years, only IES Holdings (IESC) was able to outperform the company.
I believe IES Holdings is the closest competitor to Sterling, as they both operate within data center infrastructure. However, one can't forget that these companies are diversified, with Sterling additionally offering building and transportation services.
There is no doubt the explosive growth of the company was indirectly driven by their exposure to AI. I say indirectly, as the company is heavily engaged in the data center market within its E-Infrastructure segment.
How much do I mean by heavily? Well, during the last earnings call, the CEO noted that data centers now account for over 40% of Sterling’s E-Infrastructure backlog.
The company, mainly through its subsidiary Plateau Excavation, has been awarded major contracts in the data center space this year.
For example, a recent $100 million project involves large scale underground infrastructure for a data center covering 280 acres in the southeastern US.
I considered including below a summary of the revenue and operating income per business segment from the latest 10Q.


If you look closer, the E-Infrastructure solutions segment has experienced a decline in the past year.
I have to admit that seeing this decline made me sweat. However, once you dive deeper into the report, the earnings call and the Q2 press release, the company gives a valid, and in my view, encouraging justification for this decline.
The company is undergoing a strategic shift in project focus within this segment, transitioning away from smaller, low margin projects.
The company has been redirecting its resources away from smaller commercial and warehouse projects due to their diminishing profitability.
Therefore, revenue from small commercial and warehouse work dropped by over $30 million compared to Q2, 2023​.
The company is focusing now on large-scale, high-margin projects, including data centers and manufacturing facilities.
Why am I so excited about this shift? Well, aside from indirect benefits from the company’s exposure to the current boom in AI, operating margins have improved by 480 bps, reaching a solid 21.4%.
As mentioned before, data center revenue improved by 100% YoY in the last quarter. Therefore, I believe that their increasing exposure to the data center market will only improve their profitability margins (at the cost of lower revenues).
If you read my previous articles, you probably know by now that I highly favor companies that focus on high margins rather than high revenue.
The growth in the transportation solutions segment in the past year is quite impressive, with a 54% YoY increase in the last quarter.
As a side note, this segment is focused on transportation infrastructure projects, including highways, roads, bridges, and storm drainage systems​.
The backlog of this segment increased to $1.5 billion, reflecting a 5% YoY growth. Additionally, Sterling’s pipeline of probable projects within this segment outside of signed contracts is valued at $500 million.
In my view, there is a strong indication that revenue in this segment could continue to grow in the next year. Not only due to the $500 million in potential new contracts, but also due to milestone payments bound to be released in the next quarters.
As an additional note, Sterling works in phases, starting with design work before construction phases are released. The initial design typically represents a small fraction of the total project’s value of around $1-2 million. However, subsequent construction phases can contribute significantly more, with individual construction phases valued at around $30-50 million.
During Q2 2024, Sterling secured initial design contracts for several significant highway projects. Therefore, I believe that revenue, and especially cash flows, will improve in the next quarters.
The income statement shows strong annual revenue growth in the double digits. Operating and net income follow, with a TTM increase of 27% and 35%, respectively.
In terms of profitability, the company is above the industry average for engineering and construction.


The balance sheet shows a healthy company, with a negative net debt of $152 million at the end of last quarter.
As shown below, cash and equivalents have risen significantly over the past year, while total debt has slightly decreased.


However, I have to admit that the cash flow statement is not as attractive as the income statement.
In Q1 and Q2 this year, free cash flows have declined in the double digits.


However, I am not overly concerned as the decline was driven by increased capital expenditures due to the expansion of the transportation segment. Therefore, I believe the decline in free cash flow is temporary. As soon as the milestone payments from large-scale projects will come in over the next quarters, I expect free cash flows to improve.
Additionally, we can't overlook the fact that the company's free cash flow (TTM) sits at $391 million.
A quick look at the chart below, shows most valuation ratios trading very close to the 5-year maximum range.


A notable exception is P/FCF.
Let's compare now these rations to some of the industry peers (notice not all of them are direct competitors).
If we use EV/EBITDA as the comparison metric, the company is the fourth-most expensive in the comparison group.


However, when using P/FCF as the comparison metric, the company sits in the lower half of the table.


In my view, there aren't enough signs to indicate the company is overvalued, despite the significant increase in the share price.
In my view, when the current surge in AI growth inevitably slows down (when the music stops, so to speak), the share price will likely see a double-digit decline.
I agree with most investors that the sheer increase in the share price might not be fully backed up by fundamentals.
Don't get me wrong, the fundamentals of the company look great, the balance sheet shows decent liquidity and negative net debt, and the company is trading at relatively decent valuation ratios when compared to its industry peers.
However, I agree that there might be some AI hype priced into the stock. How much, I don't know. And I make the bold statement that no one knows, considering the spectacular performance of the company outside of the e-infrastructure segment.
My bull thesis is based on the fact that the AI hype has not come to an end yet. Therefore, I believe there is plenty of room for growth in the next year or so.
To wrap up, I rate Sterling as a Strong Buy as the company is well positioned in the highly lucrative data center infrastructure market, especially benefiting from the current AI surge.
Data center revenues are up over 100% YoY, and I see potential for further growth here as AI adoption continues to drive data infrastructure expansion. However, the company is well-diversified and doesn't rely only on the e-infrastructure segment for growth. As a matter of fact, the transportation segment delivered an impressive 54% YoY growth with a strong $1.5 billion backlog.
On the fundamentals side, the company's revenue, operating, and net income growth are outpacing its industry, with a healthy balance sheet marked by negative net debt. Although free cash flow has declined this year due to an increase in capital expenditure, I expect this trend to reverse in the upcoming quarters as large transportation infrastructure projects complete milestones.
There are some risks to consider. Any cooling in AI-driven demand for data centers may cause a double-digit decline in the share price. Such a slowdown will directly impact growth within its e-infrastructure segment, leading to a decline in operating margins and profitability, despite potential improvements from the transportation segment.
However, for the moment, I haven't seen any clear signs that the AI growth will come to an abrupt stop (let me know in the comments if you do). Therefore, I have a Strong Buy rating for this stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731357-why-lincoln-national-remains-interesting-and-why-3q24-matters-only-a-little,4731357,Why Lincoln National Remains Interesting And Why Q3 2024 Matters Only A Little,"Dear readers/followers,
I have been investing in, covering, and working on articles for Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) for going on 2-3 years at this point. While my entry into this company was done at a too early time, given what happened with the company's share price and fundamentals, the low-valuation purchases that constitute over 89% of my portfolio stake in LNC at this time are up more than 50% including dividends and FX. This is an excellent RoR, and it is my conviction at this time that there is more to be had here. The market seems to agree with this assessment, given that the company rose about 2.5% in anticipation of 3Q24 earnings, which are released today.
This article will work more as a preview, but also as a piece to show you why even if 3Q24 isn't great, I'm not changing or shifting my thesis. LNC is a superb business in a turnaround, with great potential for value when it has turned around. Furthermore, the company's overall yield and upside are more than enough to justify even just holding what I own here, to get that 5-6% yield (though my own YoC is closer to 9%). Lincoln National is one of a few insurance companies that I cover on a fairly frequent basis, and if you want more detailed coverage on this or European insurance, this can be found at iREIT®+HOYA Capital.
Let's see what we have here for 3Q24.
One of my last articles was published in August 2023, and my very last was published in July this year. These articles have seen the company's return outperform averages at a 2-3x pace. You can see the latest one below.


Lincoln National is a company where I work with a number of approaches. I've worked with Puts and straight common share investments, at times investing in options just to be able to get even better returns - but my target is always a 15% annualized return on a conservative basis. The difference with me compared to other investors is that I don't really care if that return, as long as it's annualized, takes 1 year or several years to materialize. The short term is only of limited interest to me, and I only care about it if I can clearly see (or believe that I can) that the company is going to realistically decline (or advance) in the short term.
The problems for the company should, at this point, be well-known. Due to a re-valuation of its Universal life insurance lapse assumptions, we saw a crash that can certainly be compared to other, similar companies I've invested in successfully in the past, Unum (UNM) being the closest good example of something similar. The difference with these is that LNC was not a company where, based on fundamentals, you should have expected this sort of decline (that was why I invested early on), but where it nonetheless happened. The market can be fickle and impossible to predict - that is why I remain incredibly diversified with very few positions above 3% of the total. Lincoln, as of 2024, is at around 3.2%.
First, realize that re-evaluations for block policies in the insurance business are a very common thing - where LNC failed was the degree of it and failure to properly account for it before. Remember, it's the job of an insurance company to calculate risk - what happened with LNC means that the company failed to properly do so.
I have seen a fair share of the 72% RoR in the last 13 months, as is spoken about in my last article from July. Stats for the 3Q24 preview can be found here, but in essence, the consensus estimate is growth, and the company has beaten estimates 75% of the time. The stats are good.
The company's progress can be characterized as a good one. That, however, does not take away from the fact that more time is required, and we're likely years away from a reversal.
The core of my thesis is this: Are you willing to wait a few years for the company to materialize a $50-$70/share price, and be paid 5-6% per year for your trouble of waiting? If yes, this might be the company for you.
2Q24 came in August. That means I haven't covered them in an article yet. Despite them being ""old"", with new earnings set to be released today, I find them relevant.
This is because LNC showed significant progress in Annuities, up 10% (highest quarter in 2 years), life/retirement plans in line with expectations, and the company's group protection segment continuing growth even with a record prior year 2Q.
2Q24 was also the first quarter where the all-important RBC moved above 420% again. The company also established a subsidiary to better move FCF, worked expense discipline, and operating model optimizations further.
Comparing the company's results, excluding significant items and the company's various KPIs, we see a significant improvement. Above all, leverage was down once again as well, and now stands below 29%.


Looking at the company segments on a more granular basis, we quickly find that the company has not underperformed in a single one. Sales and operating income were superb, and returns have been restored to good levels. The group protection especially deserves highlighting in 2Q24, due to excellent operating income despite records last year, and loss ratios are down to multi-year lows (except Life, where 4Q of last year was better). The only segment that saw even a slight issue was retirement plan services (spread income issues), but even that segment dropped only $3M on a YoY, while also delivering net G&A declines.
Company new money yields are good, up at 6.9% from 5.8% a year ago, and the company's portfolio has an average rating of A for investments, while its CML portfolio remains comparatively small at $17B.


For my own expectations, I say that LNC actually exceeded what I expected at the half-year point. It's been a surprise to me that the company hasn't grown further in valuation, especially when you consider the RBC above 420%, which has been a major gripe with some analysts/investors and a hurdle for investing here. Not so anymore. The company also makes it clear that this continues to be a multi-year journey.
Things I continue to look at here is the company's evaluation of FCF conversion - this was at around 35% for the fiscal of last year, with a 10-20% improvement expected for the coming 2-3 years. As of 2Q24, considering the company's capital allocation, LNC is currently on track to deliver this increase (as also implied in the earnings call).
The two major positives for 2Q24, which I believe will be continuing in 3Q, are FCF conversion improvements, the RBC improvement, and operating expense improvements. These are building blocks for ongoing improvements. Given how complex LNC is as a business, this complexity means that it's sometimes tricky to see the actual progress because it's so gradual. However, it's my view that these improvements are indeed happening and that LNC today is materially improved from where the company was, even just a year ago.
For that reason, I view 2Q24 as an excellent quarter with the potential to be the first of a number of improved quarters. My view for the 3Q24 results, which are coming today, are positive - and I expect them to solidify my thesis for LNC which is a clearly positive one in terms of valuation.
Let me show you what I mean.
Lincoln National has been improving. The company had its worst year in 2022, which was also when we saw prices below $20/share for the company. Justified? I do not believe so now, and I did not believe so at the time.
LNC has a sub-41% long-term debt to cap. Despite everything, it's still BBB+ rated. The company has a yield of over 5.3% even at this time, and that yield is incredibly well covered, with less than a 40% payout ratio on the basis of adjusted EPS for 2023, even less for 2024E.
Lincoln National trades at a conservative normalized P/E of 5.9x. This is to be compared to the company's typical 10-year average of 8.7x. It's also to be considered that 2024E is bringing adjusted EPS growth of 10%, with 2025E expected to bring 32%. I'm careful with the size and specificities of these forecasts, because LNC still has a 41% negative miss ratio, even with a 20% margin of error. (Source: F.A.S.T Graphs Paywalled Link)
But the question is if the company is undervalued enough for you, the investor, to ""Buy"". I believe that it is.
Lincoln trades significantly below its normalized P/E average, while expecting significant, 19-20% annualized adjusted earnings growth. Lincoln has a well-covered yield. Lincoln is fundamentally safe (unless you think there's bankruptcy danger); Ergo, the company is a ""Buy"" because it has an upside here.
How high is this upside?
That's a different question - but here is my answer to that question.
Regardless of the turnout of 3Q24 (unless new problems of significant magnitude are introduced), LNC is a company that I view as worth at least the conservative 20-year P/E average. That average comes to 9.05x P/E. That means that the company ""peaks"" at a 9.05x P/E for 2026E which, based on current forecasts, is around $75/share based on an $8/share adjusted earnings level in 2026E, when the company's targets are or could be materialized.
This is in turn an annualized RoR of 48%, or a total 3-year ROR of 136%. And that is, dear readers, from today's levels.
Therefore, at anything below $40/share after today's 3Q24 earnings, I would still view the company as an attractive ""Buy"", and no amount of negative news, provided the news is not material enough, would deter me from this. Even if you say that the company is only worth 5-6x P/E, if you account for the reversal I view it entirely likely to happen, we're still talking a 19.2% annualized RoR in 2026E based on a 5.5x P/E. So market outperformance even in the case of very low returns.
Between earnings growth and valuation, Lincoln remains a very good ""Buy"" to me in this market - and here is what I say in terms of my 3Q24 thesis.
Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).
The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators, and 2 out of 2 valuation indicators. Based on this, and a valuation target of $55/share where I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me, I give the company a ""Buy "" rating as of October 2024. LNC still fulfills all of my fundamental criteria for investment.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731321-capital-preservation-is-key-a-contrarian-all-weather-portfolio-to-shield-against-financial-turmoil,4731321,Capital Preservation Is Key: An Unconventional Guide To Asset Allocation,"This is a follow-up to my last article, My Conservative All-Weather Portfolio is up 9% YTD, But Storms Loom. There I reviewed portfolio performance versus benchmarks and discussed why investors may face difficult markets in the coming years.
Warning: this is a contrarian and somewhat unconventional portfolio. It has tilts based on value, out of favor asset classes, historical factor premiums, and alternative assets that most mainstream financial advisors and investors will not embrace. You won’t find the Mag 7 or an S&P 500 index fund here.
The goal of this portfolio is to preserve and modestly grow real purchasing power. It has generated a steady 25-year annual return of about 6% with the worst annual drawdown of less than 5%. That certainly won’t excite aggressive or speculative investors. However, it can be suitable for those at or near retirement who want to protect what they have accumulated. Nonetheless, more aggressive investors may still benefit from employing some of the asset allocation tilts that currently present favorable risk-reward characteristics.
Here I will review my outlook for major asset classes and share my top picks in each. The table below depicts the portfolio holdings discussed in my previous all-weather articles. Later I will describe adjustments I’ve made and why.


The table below shows a summary of my views on macro factors, the implications for major asset classes and which investment vehicles are historically effective in such an environment. For the full discussion, you may wish to review my earlier articles on All-Weather Portfolio investing.


In 2019, Mean Reversion + Valuation = Opportunity and the subsequent SA Editor’s pick, Mean Reversion + Valuation = Portfolio Opportunities, highlighted asset classes that had subpar performance over the previous five years and noted:
Fast forwarding to January 2024, Asset Class Mean Reversion: 2024 Review and Outlook included the table below and stated:


Now let’s turn to recent data via the table below. Mean reversion is still in process for the assets highlighted in blue. All of them have returned significantly more during the recent five years versus the five years ending 2019. And all except emerging markets equities have performed better over the past five years versus the 20 years ending 2019.


Yet in 2024 and over the past five years, U.S. large cap and large growth sectors continued to outperform almost everything else. The only exception was gold, the top-performing asset class, up 28% through the end of September. The Mag 7 accounted for 60% of the return of the S&P 500 in the first half of this year, driving U.S. large caps up 21% YTD, but for how long?
The chart below shows the relative performance of U.S. growth vs. value stocks over time.


Growth has trounced value over most periods over the past 30 years. However, there have been periods where value outperformed, including 2000-2007, 2020 and 2022. The growth to value ratio has typically been below 2 during the past 54 years. However, it reached an all-time high over 3 in 2020. Since declining in 2022, growth has again ruled and stands at 3.3.
Yet, since June of this year value has taken the lead. Value stocks also tend to do well during inflationary periods. Should we experience a stagflationary period or even worse – a major financial crisis – value could outperform for years to come.
Rob Arnott, founder of Research Affiliates, recently told Barron's:
U.S. equities have outperformed the rest of the world since 2008. There was a brief hiatus during the 2022 market decline when foreign reigned supreme. Yet, over the past 50+ years one can see foreign equities have had multi-year periods of outperformance. The ratio of U.S. to foreign is the highest ever. But it was also the highest ever back in 2015 and the trend has persisted.


Emerging markets equities have also been trounced by the S&P 500 index over the past decade. The MSCI Emerging Markets index gained 53% versus the S&P’s 250% cumulative return. But in August and September, emerging markets started to outperform, returning 8.4%, beating the S&P 500 by four percentage points.
Recently, Bridgewater Investments published U.S. Exceptionalism, Drivers of Equity Outperformance, And What’s Needed for a Repeat. One takeaway: “Going forward, the hurdle for continued U.S. outperformance is high, and a lot depends on technology.”
Will the U.S. continue its dominance? I recommend reading Ray Dalio’s insightful perspective in The Changing World Order, Great Powers Index 2024. If you aren’t already familiar, here’s a sneak preview: his indicators show the U.S. has peaked and is in relative decline.
The chart below shows valuations for major asset classes. The S&P 500 index and U.S. large cap growth standout for their lofty valuations. At the other end, the international, emerging and natural resources sectors have appeal for value investors.


The U.S. market trades at 37X CAPE while international markets are cheaper, with the European market trading at 21X CAPE and the Japanese market at 25X CAPE at the end of Q2.
Value stocks might also provide a cushion in the event of a major market decline. We saw this play out in 2022 when the S&P 500 dropped 18% while the less-pricey Vanguard Value Index ETF (VTV) declined only 2%. But VTV has gotten expensive more recently, with a PE ratio of 21.
Now let’s turn to portfolio adjustments. Given the assessment described in My Conservative All-Weather Portfolio is Up 9% YTD, But Storms Loom and my evolving risk-return profile, I have reduced my equity allocation from 20% to 15% of the portfolio. That includes 10% in natural resources equities (see below) and 5% in foreign equities:
The small overall equity allocation, relative valuations, global uncertainties, and market sentiment led me to remove all U.S. equities from the portfolio, except for natural resources.
Given the fiscal outlook, with more than $35 trillion in U.S. government debt and an annual interest burden over $1 trillion, I continue to favor real assets. This includes gold, silver, natural resources equities, and MLPs. My All-Weather portfolio carries 15% in gold, 5% in silver, 4% in diversified natural resources, 3% in MLPs and 3% in agriculture for a total real asset allocation of 30%.
My outlook for gold and silver is positive. Both have broken out this year but look ripe for a correction. Gold keeps setting new all-time highs and is up 33% YTD. I discussed what to look for in my gold article series led by Where is Gold Going? Watch Sentiment Not Fundamentals. For a fundamental view on gold, see The Case for $5,000 Gold, written in 2022 when gold was at $1,851. It has gained 48% since, while the S&P 500 gained 27%.
Silver is up 46% YTD and appears to have a lot more room to run. There is a good possibility that silver will continue to outperform gold. The gold to silver ratio sits at about 84, well above its longer-term average of about 60. Rising demand for silver is a tailwind, due to its role in clean energy, technology and medical applications.
Back in June 2020, in the early stages of the pandemic, no one was worried about inflation. There was even talk of deflation, with CPI running at an annualized 1.2%. At the time, I wrote Natural Resources Equities: Preparing for Inflation and a Dollar Decline, followed by Load Up GUNR to Defend Against Inflation and a Dollar Decline. Afterwards, annualized inflation peaked at 10% and GUNR has gained 71%. I continue to be bullish about natural resources and hold GUNR for the long term.
Similarly, MLPs were beaten up badly and highly out of favor, having lost a miserable 8.6% per year over the five years ending 2019. True to the mean-reversion dynamic, they gained 12% per year over the past five years. My preferred holding is MLPX, up 27% YTD.
My agriculture allocation is 3% with farmland as the vehicle. I have a small stake in Farmland Partners (FPI). The stock has languished over the past year but is an interesting asset play. Here are two recent SA articles with good insights: Farmland Partners Massive Land Sale Demonstrates Asset Value and Farmland Partners: Selling A Quarter of Their Book Confirms 50% Upside to NAV. I am also considering an additional diversified agriculture ETF and will report later, depending on what my research uncovers.
Over the next decade, there is a good chance inflation will run considerably hotter than the Fed’s 2% target. In previous articles, I discussed how the post-Covid period may mirror the post-war 1940s. During that time, the Fed monetized the federal debt and annual inflation ranged from -2% to 18%, averaging 5.5% for the decade. TIPS aren’t a perfect inflation hedge but provide a reasonable vehicle for protection, along with portfolio diversification:
TIPS Performance Could Rival That of the S&P 500 Over the Next Decade
TIPS Funds vs. A Ladder
How TIPS Might Perform At Financial Extremes
My portfolio allocates 25% to inflation protected securities, with 18% in TIPS and 7% in I-bonds. Real TIPS yields over the past year have been the highest in 15 years. Earlier this they declined but have rebounded recently. The bond market is signaling higher long-term inflation expectations due to Fed easing. As of this writing, real yields are about 2% for 10- year TIPS. That is attractive on a historical basis. My expectation is for nominal total returns of about 4-7% for 10-year TIPS held to maturity. That could be higher if inflation runs hot.
Reliance on U.S. issued bonds presents a real and growing risk that wasn’t present decades ago. The government’s fiscal position and Fed accommodation don’t bode well for the dollar and long-term Treasuries. Indeed, a few days ago, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones issued a bleak warning about the perils of U.S. government debt and emphatically stated he won’t own them.
My approach is two-fold: 1) I carry a short-intermediate term Treasury note ladder with an average maturity of three years, and 2) I’ve reduced the previous allocation target from 25% Treasuries to 15%. I moved 5% into high-quality, short-term munis via Vanguard Limited Term Tax Exempt Fund (VMLUX) and 5% into cash and CDs.
As I mentioned at the outset, this is an unconventional, contrarian portfolio. I believe the biggest risk for investors is opportunity cost. If U.S. stocks continue to outperform foreign stocks for years to come and growth continues to trounce value, investors will miss out on some gains. Even worse, if commodities reverse course, the heavy portfolio allocation can lead to subpar returns, or even losses.
Conventional portfolios may face significant drawdowns for a long period. A well-diversified all-weather portfolio should protect and grow capital, regardless of financial conditions. Elevated risks place a premium on capital preservation, especially for conservative investors at or near retirement. Many previously out of favor asset classes have had a resurgence and may outperform those now in vogue, particularly the tech-laden S&P 500 index. Yet, this approach requires investors to exhibit contrarianism and patience, which some will be hard-pressed to embrace.
I look forward to your comments.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731352-wingstop-q3-market-expectations-didnt-support-earnings-hiccup,4731352,Wingstop Q3: Market Expectations Didn't Support An Earnings Hiccup (Rating Upgrade),"Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING), the restaurant chain known for its chicken wings, reported the company’s Q3 results on the 30th of October in pre-market hours. While Wingstop reported incredible growth, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations, the stock reacted with a 20% decline at the time of writing – the revenue growth didn’t translate to good profitability due to higher-than-expected costs. The very tight valuation doesn’t support such slight hiccups in performance, seemingly causing the dramatic reaction.
In my previous article on the stock, Wingstop: Franchising Success Isn’t Enough Anymore, I initiated the stock at a Sell rating due to its incredibly ambitious valuation, ahead of the undeniable franchising success story. Since the article was published on the 3rd of July, Wingstop’s stock has lost -29% of its value compared to an S&P 500 appreciation of 6%.


Wingstop’s Q3 report showed great continued growth. Revenues came in at $162.5 million, growing 38.8% year-on-year and beating Wall Street’s expectations by $2.6 million. Total outstanding units increased by 359 year-on-year and by 106 sequentially to 2458, and the domestic same-restaurant sales growth reached 20.9% in a slowly growing industry sales environment as the more recently opened units continue maturing.
On top of the Q3 growth itself, the growth story is accelerating as Wingstop raised the company’s 2024 unit expansion outlook. The company now expects net new unit openings of 320 to 330 in the year compared to 285 to 300 previously. Overall, the Q3 report clearly continued to strengthen Wingstop’s growth story as the company continues to expand both domestically and in international markets. The 20% domestic same-store sales growth outlook was reiterated.
I believe that the momentum paves ground for very great continued growth. Of the total 106 Q3 net restaurant openings, 26 were in international markets, very slowly turning Wingstop's focus on additional markets.
Despite Wingstop’s greater-than-expected revenue growth, the company’s earnings came below expectations. The EPS came in at $0.88, missing Wall Street’s consensus by $0.07.
Underneath, Wingstop’s profitability took a step back from Q2 as the operating margin declined by 2.0 percentage points to 24.5%. The company experienced adverse effects in the company-owned restaurants as food, beverage, and packaging costs rose by 1.2 percentage points of revenues sequentially to 37.0%, and as labor costs rose by 0.1 percentage points and other expenses rose by 0.7 percentage points of revenues, ultimately contributing to lower income from company-owned operations.
On top of weak company-owned restaurant earnings, Wingstop’s SG&A costs rose unexpectedly much. Advertising costs increased by 43.8% year-on-year to $61.0 million, rising as a percentage of revenues, and general & administrative costs increased by $9.2 million to $32.3 million, negating most underlying operating leverage due to higher stock-based compensation. The company also raised its 2024 SBC & SG&A guidance ranges to reflect the higher expense level.
As the stock’s reaction suggests, Wingstop’s incredibly tight valuation didn’t allow for a hiccup in the financials. I believe that a temporary cost increase related to more expensive chicken is mostly irrelevant in the overall long-term growth story, but the higher general & administrative costs do pose a more moderate margin expansion outlook that the stock’s valuation didn’t support going into the report.
I updated my discounted cash flow [DCF] model with a shift into the company’s organic franchising strategy instead of factoring in franchised restaurant acquisitions as I did previously – I believe that the model more fairly represents Wingstop as an investment now given the current pace of restaurant acquisitions.
Due to the change in my valuation approach, I now estimate slower, but still great revenue growth at a 16.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2033, enabled by improving same-restaurant sales and the consistent unit expansion. The 2033 revenue expectation of $2177.9 million considers around 7000 restaurants in the year as well as fairly good same-restaurant sales growth – in Q3, an average franchised unit generated $223.3 thousand of annualized revenues, which would imply $1563.1 million in franchise revenues in 2033 without any same-restaurant sales growth. Total annualized company-owned sales were $125.4 million in Q3.
With the franchising approach, Wingstop’s profitability should slightly increase due to operating leverage. Still, I believe that additional costs in new market entries will also pressure the margin expansion, and Wingstop’s weaker-than-expected Q3 profitability weighs on the margin expectation especially due to rising SG&A. As such, I estimate the company’s EBIT margin to reach a 26.5% level.
The franchising strategy comes with a good cash flow conversion due to minimal working capital requirements and quite moderate capital expenditures.
I again estimate an exit EV/EBIT multiple of 25, still factoring in further growth after 2033.


The estimates put Wingstop’s fair value estimate at $258.36, 13% below the stock price at the time of writing – even after the recent stock decline, I believe that Wingstop’s stock is valued with too much ambition in a base scenario.
Although an overvaluation remains in my DCF model, the overvaluation is now more moderate and falls within a margin of safety – while still not a fair base scenario, the stock could be a fair investment at the current price when considering the potential for significantly more than 7000 global units. Yum! Brands (YUM) had 30689 KFC restaurants outstanding after Q2, noting the possibility of significantly more units in international markets over the very long term. I still regard such a scenario as unlikely due to the Wingstop brand’s weak brand presence in international markets so far, though.
Acquired restaurants could also add additional value to the fair value estimate, which I now don’t account for in the model.
The DCF model uses a weighted average cost of capital of 8.75%. The used WACC is derived from a capital asset pricing model:


In Q3, Wingstop had $5.1 million in interest expenses, making the company’s interest rate 2.88% with the current amount of interest-bearing debt. I now estimate a lower 7% long-term debt-to-equity ratio.
To estimate the cost of equity, I use the 10-year bond yield of 4.22% as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.11% is Professor Aswath Damodaran’s estimate for the US, updated in July. I have kept the beta estimate at 1.19. With a liquidity premium of 0.1%, the cost of equity stands at 9.21% and the WACC at 8.75%.
Wingstop reported incredibly strong Q3 growth and a raised unit expansion outlook, raising faith in the growth story. On the contrary, the profitability came in well below expectations due to weak company-owned restaurant income and rising SG&A. The incredibly tight valuation didn’t allow for a hiccup in the earnings growth, leading to a share crash, even though I don’t believe that the earnings hiccup was too dramatic in nature.
While the stock remains expensive, the unlikely potential for very notable long-term international market penetration and the potential for accretive restaurant acquisitions make up for most of the DCF model’s estimated overvaluation. As such, I remain cautious of the stock due to the still quite tight valuation and rising SG&A, but upgrade my rating on Wingstop to Hold.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731348-avge-fund-of-equity-funds-worth-considering,4731348,AVGE: A Fund Of Equity Funds Worth Considering,"A lot of fund issuers often create a new fund that invests in their fund suite, mixing and matching portfolios so that investors can get a blended all-in-one fund that is ultra diversified and automatically matches their needs. The Avantis All Equity Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:AVGE) is one of those fund of funds that does just that. By blending a variety of equity ETFs that trade under different tickers, AVGE basically is recreating an all-equity portfolio split up among domestic, international, and style tilts with the hope of outperforming any single one of the underlying funds over a full cycle.
But is it worth it?
The top position goes to the Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (AVUS). At nearly 44%, this serves as the core holding for the product. It's more of a total market proxy than anything else.


The second-largest holding is the value fund, the Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (AVLV). This position adds a value slant to the whole portfolio, which might lead to better returns over time. Next up? The Avantis International Equity ETF (AVDE), which gives investors access to a wide range of companies in developed markets outside the U.S. This holding plays a key role in diversifying the fund to allow for exposure into Europe, Japan, and other developed economies. After that comes the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (AVEM), which puts money into a broad group of companies in emerging economies offering exposure to fast-growing markets like China, India, and Brazil. Finally comes the Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (AVIV) which focuses in on large-cap value stocks in international developed markets.
This mix helps AVGE keep a wide-ranging portfolio across different market sizes, approaches, and locations, while also keeping expenses quite low.
AVGE's sector allocation shows its broad market strategy, leaning toward sectors that often have value features. Financials and Industrials make up the largest allocations here. Tech is a much lower weighting here than what we find in broad-based averages.


This allocation gives a well-rounded exposure across different parts of the economy, with a bit more weight in Financials and Industrials compared to some broad market indexes.
When it comes to global allocation, AVGE keeps a big focus on its home country, with about 70% of its assets invested in the United States. The other 30% is spread out across various international markets.


This allocation gives investors a chance to keep a strong position in the U.S. market while also getting significant exposure to international economies, both developed and emerging.
When we look at how AVGE stacks up against its peers, we should keep in mind that its fund-of-funds structure makes it a bit different. Many global equity ETFs either follow a specific index or invest in individual stocks. AVGE's method of using other Avantis ETFs as building blocks makes it stand out.
When you compare AVGE to a fund like the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT), you'll see AVGE allocates more to U.S. stocks and leans more towards value. It might generate higher returns because it targets securities expected to perform better, but this could lead to more ups and downs.
You could also look at the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS) as a similar option. However, AVGE stands out by including U.S. stocks and taking a more hands-on approach to picking securities within its underlying funds.
What sets AVGE apart is its potential to boost returns through its methodical approach to choosing and weighting securities. At the same time, it maintains wide diversification and keeps costs down.


On the plus side, AVGE gives investors a single place to get global stock exposure. Its structure as a fund-of-funds spreads your risk across different markets, sectors, and ways of investing. This appeals to people who want a hands-off way to invest in global stocks, but still hope for better returns. The fund's focus on stocks with higher expected returns is another possible upside. By looking at things like value and profit, AVGE tries to do better than just following market size over time.
AVGE's low expense ratio is a big plus. With a net expense ratio of 0.23%, it's competitive given its global reach and active management. This low cost helps to reduce the impact of high fees on returns over time.
But there are also some downsides to think about. The fund puts about 70% into U.S. stocks, which might not work for investors who want more balanced global exposure. This focus on home stocks can be good when U.S. markets are doing well, but it could lead to worse results when international markets are ahead.
The fund's focus on value stocks might pay off in the long run, but it can also cause it to lag behind at times, especially when growth stocks are hot. You need to be okay with the fact that this fund might not always move in sync with the broader market.
Another thing to think about is that this fund hasn't been around for long. AVGE started in September 2022, so there's not much history for investors to look at. Even though the strategy it uses and the funds it includes might have been around longer, the way AVGE puts them all together is still pretty new.
The Avantis All Equity Markets ETF offers an interesting choice to investors who want wide global stock exposure with a methodical approach to boost returns. Its fund-of-funds setup, along with its emphasis on stocks with higher expected returns, makes it stand out from many similar global stock funds. Worth considering as a core allocation.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731344-austrian-post-this-business-has-no-fundamental-appeal,4731344,Austrian Post: This Business Has No Fundamental Appeal,"I have been covering various companies in Europe that are pivoting from mail towards parcel deliveries. Examples include PostNL and bpost, neither of which are among my preferred investments. With this report, I am adding Austrian Post (OTC:OERCF) to my coverage. I will be discussing the company's activities, which unlike the name suggests stretch beyond Austria, the most recent earnings, the risks and opportunities, followed by a stock price target and rating.
Austrian Post is a freight and logistics group, which posted €2.7 billion in sales in 2023 and €392 million in EBITDA. The company has three reporting segments, namely Mail, Parcel & Logistics and Retail & Bank. The Mail segment accounts for 43% of the revenues and includes letter mail, direct mail and newspapers and magazines. The Parcel & Logistics segment provides e-commerce services, fulfillment, cash transport and express delivery and accounts for 52% of the revenues while the remainder is driven by financial services. Financial services might seem like an odd segment for Austrian Post, but it should be kept in mind that years ago it was common that post offices were used to deposit cash money. From there, many mail companies built a segment providing financial services and some companies still operate that segment, though in different forms than years ago.
Important to keep in mind is that Austrian Post is not only active in Austria, but also in Germany, Greece and Turkey as well as Central and Eastern Europe.


Revenues in the first half of 2024 increased by 17.2% and 10.3% when excluding the business in Turkey, which benefits from favorable inflation and currency effects. The mail segment saw revenues increase by 3.5% benefiting from price increases despite lower volumes. Parcel & Logistics saw revenues increase by 28.1% and 15.2% excluding the Turkish activities. This was driven by higher volumes in Austria despite subdued real GDP growth in Austria and volume growth in Central and Eastern Europe. EBIT grew 10.9% to €105.6 million with inflation driving higher staff costs, transportation costs and raw material costs. Not all of those costs have been passed through resulting in EBIT margins contracting from 7.4% to 7% percent.
The main risks for Austrian Post include a continued decline in mail volumes and the possibility of softer volume growth for parcel deliveries. At the same time, the company also has some opportunities and risk mitigating factors. Continued growth in ecommerce over the longer term will continue to drive parcel flow from Asia to Europe, and being positioned in Central Europe, Austrian Post could play an important role in parcel delivery throughout Europe when the network is intelligently leveraged. Furthermore, self-service solutions such as parcel lockers are also seeing higher volumes, which reduces the pressure from labor somewhat since the traditional last-mile delivery process is labor-intensive. In the mail segment, while volumes are challenging, Austrian Post is adjusting its prices accordingly and Austria has a concession system for the distribution of newspapers and magazines. The concession is valid for five years and the company has held the concession since 1999. So, I would say it is rather safe to assume that for the foreseeable future, if ever, this will not change.


To determine multi-year price targets, The Aerospace Forum has developed a stock screener which uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows and the most recent balance sheet data. Each quarter, we revisit those assumptions, and the stock price targets accordingly. In a separate blog, I have detailed our analysis methodology.
While I do like the geographical positioning of Austria for parcel deliveries throughout Europe. From a fundamental perspective, Austrian Post has little to offer. EBITDA is expected to be flat and while free cash is expected to improve in the years ahead, that is not enough to provide any significant upside against the company median EV/EBITDA. With flat EBITDA, I also do not see a good reason to value the stock in line with peers. With that in mind, I believe the stock which has greater liquidity at the Vienna Stock Exchange is a hold at best and most likely an underperformer.
While the volume trends for parcels are upward driven by ecommerce strength, the reality is that Austrian Post is unlikely to generate significant EBITDA growth in the years ahead as costs are increasing and competition for parcel delivery is fierce. I also believe the company is a step behind in self-service solutions to decrease the pressure on the last mile delivery network. As a result, I mark the shares a hold, and I would probably even sell them if I did own any shares.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731341-houlihan-lokey-stock-overvalued-no-realistic-upside-hold,4731341,"Houlihan Lokey: We've Seen Plenty Of Upside, But I Say This One Is A 'Hold'","Dear readers/followers,
In this article, I will look at the company Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI), my first update for about 4 months since the latest results, looking both at the 1Q25 upside, the 2024E-2025E upside, and beyond. The company has a different fiscal cycle, so this is to be taken into consideration here. Houlihan Lokey has outperformed the S&P500, making my last thesis in my article found here, somewhat incorrect (or at the very least my rating).
Houlihan Lokey is a good business, and I've owned shares in the company since 2023. Another interesting fact is that Houlihan Lokey is actually the company advising Intrum, one of my largest company holdings, in their current capital restructuring process.
So, while I cannot take credit for a continued ""Buy"" rating, which I did not give - I can take credit for my original buy rating, and the position therein, which I still hold at this particular time.
I do not believe Houlihan Lokey to be a significantly interesting company at this juncture. The company may be the #1 Global restructuring advisor, as well as multiple other leading positions in the industry as well, but this does not make the company worth ""anything"" - and that's what we'll look at and try to confirm in this particular article.
Let's see what we have here.
Aas a leading global investment bank with significant expertise in crucial fields - including but not limited to M&A, Capital structure and markets, financial markets and valuation advisory, this company has its work cut out for itself over the coming few years (and during the last years as well, judging by its performance).


Some updated basic stats and fundamentals for the company - because once we go into valuation, this article will quickly go ""Out of whack"".
Houlihan Lokey remains unrated, but with a sub-18% long-term debt to capital and being an investment bank/brokerage, this doesn't mean that the company ""needs it"" to be safe. Despite the lack of a CR, I view the company as safe. Houlihan Lokey had a significant spike in interest during ZIRP, when the company's adjusted EPS grew several years at over 44% per year, only to decline 36% in 2023, and is expected to drop another 1% in 2024E. In short, despite the company's expected EPS decline this year, Houlihan Lokey is still seeing growth in EPS.
This is based on, in my interpretation, the company's supposed upside in the next few years after that. The problem with those assumptions is that Houlihan Lokey actually misses its estimates more than 55% of the time, with either negative or positive misses. It's a volatile business, and that doesn't mesh well with the way the company has been trading.
When I bought Houlihan Lokey back in -23, and I wish I had bought it in -22, the company was cheap for the expectations, even the conservative expectations, that could be considered here.
Now the company isn't even cheap for the most positive assumptions I can consider being somewhat valid for the business - and that is a very big change.


The latest results are 1Q25 but are based on the calendar year, during July of 2024.
The notion that Houlihan Lokey is continuing to grow at a high pace is easily disproven by a number of KPIs, such as Revenues, adjusted income (pre-tax), and adjusted margin.


While the results you see above are good, they are nowhere near as good to drive the valuation levels we'll look at soon here. I believe also part of the overvaluation that HLI has is the fact that it can argue it's a clear market leader in every field where it is active.


And not just in the segments themselves, but also in every single end market, from business services to Consumers. Different than some companies that are niche-focused, such as Lazard (LAZ), Houlihan Lokey handles the spectrum of end-markets and industries, and seems to excel in all. Its client mix is diverse, its segment mix is appealing, and while its geographical mix could use some improvement, it's weighted up by a very attractive industry mix, with over 2000+ clients per year, with no single transaction being higher than 2% of annual revenues, and no single client being more than 2% of revenues. Even Intrum, as significant a transaction as it is, is only a small client for the company.


But none of these positives gel all that well with the valuation. Even if, I do, expect the company to significantly outperform here, I at the same time believe that the valuation for a company should not and cannot stretch ad infinitum. That is the situation we've seen in Houlihan Lokey at this time. Despite actual earnings being flat since 2023 when they dropped, and the recent earnings report giving no suggestion that there is a massive increase coming here (meaning over 15%), the market has continued to apply a significant premium, even increasing that premium the last year.
This is the disconnect of which I speak. A few years ago, HLI was trading at less than 13x normalized for the year - now the P/E is 32.8x, and here are the current estimates for where the company would or could be going over the next few years' time. The company's price is now $166/share, and while there is expected EBITDA and earnings growth, none of what is expected even until 2027E is justifying this premium, because even the 2027E results are lower than the peak 2022A results, when the company was trading far cheaper than it is now.


As I've detailed before, the market has a tendency towards overreaction in either direction. It's my conviction that this is something that has increased in this age of digital and electronic trading. The short-term thinking dominates - and this is not just my stance either. The rise of things like algorithmic trading and the democratization of investments have put a lot of new capital on the markets. (Source)
As with anything about the stock market, I do not consider it necessarily a bad or a good thing. I just consider it to be a ""thing"" that we need to learn how to handle. In this case, I tend to disregard market overreaction, both negative and positive. If they become excessive, such as scenarios where the overreactions result in me being able to make a hefty profit, that is the exception, and it's my belief that we have that situation today, and for Houlihan Lokey.
This forms the way I handle my thesis this time around and is why I am selling/rotating my stake in the business.
The reason that I wrote this article and why I am careful about the returns here, in the sense that I want to realize them, is that as of a few days ago, the company is at a 100% RoR inclusive of dividends and FX.
Those sorts of returns in that sort of timeframe (1.5 years) do not happen often. While my HLI position isn't life-changing in the context of my portfolio, this will free a fair chunk of capital which can be invested in more attractive and conservatively valued businesses.
Houlihan Lokey trades at above 32.5x P/E and typically manages 16.5x P/E. That means the company is now twice the usual valuation, and even that valuation is a premium to a more normalized P/E of 15x. This is downright dangerous. This is also one of the situations where a picture can say better than words what it is that I see.


As you can see in the graph, the overvaluation we see here is unlike anything that we've seen in the past 10 years, which is as long as this company has been publically traded like this. The company's yield is small as well, below 1.4%. Forecasting the company at a 15.5x P/E conservative, even with growth rates of 15% per annum, comes to a double-digit negative annualized rate of return, or a total negative RoR of 31% until 2027E. And that is if the company manages its actual return and positive rates. At 16.5x, the company's historical average, it's still negative 28% inclusive of the dividend.
So at what valuation would the company actually deliver positive RoR or a 15% annualized, potentially market-beating rate of return? That would require around 22.8x, or 23x, and at that valuation, HLI is giving you 1.61% per year inclusive of the 1.37% dividend. And that's less than 4% until 2027.
In order to get 15% annualized, it wouldn't be enough even to expect 29x P/E - you'd have to forecast HLI at 31x P/E, based on current forecasts, which the company has never held for a long time as this.
I make these lengthy discussions on valuation to illustrate to you the likelihood, or in this case the lack of likelihood, for outperformance under normal valuational circumstances, and why I believe the risk/reward ratio in this investment no longer makes any sort of sense.
What I am showing you here is also why I will be selling/rotating my HLI stake. You could ""Hold"" here, which also is my rating for the company here - but in doing so, you run the risk of being left with shares when this game of financial musical chairs comes to an end and the stock drops. I believe investors and the market have been somewhat blinded by how well the company is doing and not seeing where it has gone in valuation.
Because of this imbalance in expectations, potential, and fair value, I believe the equation here no longer makes sense. I am therefore giving the company the following thesis.
Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).
The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators, but 0 out of 2 valuation indicators. Based on this, and a valuation target of $95/share where I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me, I give the company a ""Hold"" rating as of October 2024. I won't call it cheap, and it no longer has a good enough realistic upside for me to invest in. This is still a ""hold"", with the difference that I am now rotating my position.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731340-bank-of-nova-scotia-fixed-income-vs-equity-investment,4731340,Bank of Nova Scotia: Fixed Income Vs. Equity Investment,"The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS), the third-largest bank in Canada by assets, operates across various countries in North and Latin America in segments such as consumer, commercial, investment banking, and asset & wealth management.
In this analysis, we aim to determine whether it is the best bank in Canada and if there are good opportunities to invest in the company's equity or fixed-income securities. First, we assess the bank's fundamental advantages in terms of growth and diversification compared to other Canadian banks, compiling its revenue breakdown by segment and key metrics, and comparing them with competitors' historical growth performance. We also evaluate the market share and geographical diversification of the company relative to other top Canadian banks, particularly focusing on its exposure to Pacific Alliance countries and the rationale behind it. Additionally, we analyze the bank's profitability by reviewing trends in earnings and margins, and by calculating profitability ratios such as ROE (using Dupont analysis), ROA, net income margins, and management efficiency over the past decade, comparing these metrics with those of its Canadian peers. Finally, we examine the bank's financial strength by analyzing its capital adequacy ratios (Tier 1 and Total CAR), liquidity ratios (LCR and LDR), asset quality ratios (NPL, loan loss, coverage ratios), and its probability of default using a banking z-score, comparing these factors with those of other leading Canadian banks.
Firstly, we examine whether BNS has a fundamental advantage over other banks in Canada in terms of growth and diversification.
We first compile the total assets of the top 8 largest banks in Canada over the past 10 years, including the ""Royal Bank of Canada (RY), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal (BMO), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM), National Bank of Canada (OTCPK:NTIOF), Laurentian Bank of Canada (OTCPK:LRCDF), and the Canadian Western Bank (OTCPK:CBWBF)"".


The chart above shows a relatively stable trend in the share of total assets among the leading Canadian banks over the past decade. The Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank consistently hold the top two positions, with their combined market share of assets have been very stable. The Bank of Nova Scotia experienced a slight decreasing trend in market share, dropping from 20.3% in 2014 to 17.3% in 2023, yet it maintained its third position in the market. The Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce both saw slight gains in market share over the decade, retaining their positions as the fourth and fifth-largest banks, respectively. Meanwhile, smaller banks like the National Bank of Canada and the Canadian Western Bank maintained consistent market positions throughout this period.
We examine the company's segment breakdown based on its annual reports in the past 10 years as well as H1 2024 to analyze its growth trend.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
BNS' revenue growth across its segments has shown consistent and stable performance over the years, with average growth rates being fairly close among its different segments. Furthermore, Banking has the highest CAGR of 5.0% compared to its other segments, and its Banking revenue growth has been steady over the last 10 years with a decrease in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the Global Wealth Management and Capital Markets segments have also demonstrated steady growth, with a CAGR of 2% and 3% YoY, respectively. Despite some fluctuations in specific years, the overall trend indicates a balanced and reliable growth pattern across the bank's key business areas, underscoring its diversified and stable revenue generation capabilities.
We examine the company's revenue growth across its Consumer, Commercial, Wealth Management, Capital Markets, and Insurance segments, comparing it with the top 5 Canadian banks.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
The table shows BNS's relatively lower growth across its segments compared to its competitors. In the Banking segment, BNS has revenues of CAD 27.1 bln, but its CAGR of 5.0% is slightly better than RBC (4.5%) and on par with CIBC (5.8%), yet lower than TD Bank (5.1%) and significantly below BMO's strong growth of 8.7%. In Wealth Management, BNS's CAGR of 2.2% is notably lower than its competitors, particularly RBC (12.0%), CIBC (6.3%), and TD Bank (7.2%), and even below BMO (3.7%). In the Capital Markets segment, BNS has a 3.1% CAGR, which is lower than TD Bank (9.0%), CIBC (9.5%), and RBC (4.6%). Overall, BNS's growth rates are generally lower than its competitors in most segments, except for the Banking segment, where it performs better than RBC and is on par with CIBC.
Moreover, we then compare the company's geographic revenue breakdown with its top competitors below to determine whether it had a diversification advantage.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
Based on the table above, the company's 10-year average Canadian % of revenue is 53.2%, which is among the lowest compared to its competitors. Furthermore, its average US presence in % of revenue is also the lowest at 5.9%. In contrast, its competitors such as RBC (23%), TD Bank (35.4%), BMO (35.1%) and CIBC (11.5%) have a much larger geographical presence in the US. Notably, the company has a substantial portion of its revenue coming from other international countries, as its average other international % is the highest at 40.9%, while the second highest, RBC is less than half of that averaging at 16.4%. We believe this overall highlights BNS's geographic revenue diversification across multiple countries other than Canada and the US.


Based on the chart, the company derives 53.03% of its revenue from Canada, making Canada the largest regional contributor. Additionally, the remaining 46.97% is spread across various international markets, Mexico (9.41%), Colombia (7.92%), the Caribbean and Central America (7.50%), and the Pacific Alliance countries like Chile (7.34%) and Peru (5.49%).


On average, the International Banking segment has demonstrated stronger growth, with an average total revenue growth of 4% YoY compared to the Canadian Banking segment's average growth of 2% YoY. When breaking down specific components, the international segment outpaces the Canadian segment in net interest income growth, averaging 6% YoY compared to 6% YoY in the Canadian segment. However, both segments show an identical 6% average growth in net interest income. In terms of net fee and commission revenues, the International Banking segment shows a modest average growth of 2% YoY, whereas the Canadian Banking segment experienced a decline, averaging -2% YoY.


*Personal Loans from 2014 to 2016 include Credit Cards
BNS' International Banking segment outperforms its Canadian Banking segment in both total loan growth and interest income as a percentage of loans. The International segment shows an average total loan growth of 9.1% YoY, significantly higher than the 5.2% YoY growth in the Canadian segment. Additionally, the interest income as a percentage of loans is much stronger in the International segment, averaging 5.4%, compared to 2.2% in the Canadian segment.
Overall, we believe the company does not indicate a significant competitive advantage based on our analysis of its growth, as its average growth CAGR is 3.5%, whereas its competitors such as CIBC (6.7%) and BMO (6.2%) are substantially higher. Based on a comparison analysis of its segment revenues, we highlighted that its Capital Markets and Wealth Management segments' revenue growth had underperformed the top 5 banks. We believe a reason for its lower growth could be due to the lower growth in the South American investment banking market compared to Canada, with a CAGR of 1.35% vs 3.14%. Furthermore, South America's M&A volume is the second-lowest region, accounting for only $0.48 tln in 2023 while North America accounted for $1.67 tln. According to Statista, factors in the region include ""challenges related to political instability, complex regulations, corruption, and economic uncertainty"".
However, we believe the firm has a geographical diversification advantage as its non-Canada % revenue is the highest among its competitors, at 57%. Its non-Canada non-US % revenue also ranks the highest at 39.6%, whereas its closest competitor RBC has only 15.9%. We believe that geographical diversification is beneficial for its outlook because of its international banking high loan growth rate (9.1%) and high-interest income % loan (5.4%) compared to Canadian loan growth (5.2%). We believe that its international loan growth is beneficial for its outlook. This is because non-Canada and non-US countries have higher average forecasted GDP growth, which would result in higher economic activity and a higher demand for loans.
Source: International Monetary Fund, Khaveen Investments
This is as its international developing markets such as Peru, Chile, and Columbia are forecasted to grow 2.4%, 2.3%, and 2.6% respectively with the Caribbean and Central America at 5.8%, which is significantly higher than Canada's 1.8%. Additionally, we believe the high international interest income % loan is also beneficial for its outlook, as 2025 forecasted interest rates in Peru, Chile, and Columbia are expected to be 5%, 4.5%, and 9.75% respectively, which we believe bodes well for international banking income growth and provides another international diversification benefit that differentiates it from its competitors. Notably, the company has a strong and stable market share in Latin America (10% average market share) as well as the Caribbean and Central Americas, as Peru, Chile, Columbia, and Mexico have averaged 17%, 14%, 5%, 8%, over the past 5 years respectively. We believe that its strong and stable market share highlights another key strength of its international banking segment and bodes with the company's outlook. Overall, we believe that while the company does not have any significant fundamental advantage in terms of growth against other Canadian banks, it does have a strong diversification advantage against them.
Next, we focus on assessing the bank's profitability and determining whether it has superior profitability compared to other top Canadian banks.
We analyze the bank's profitability trends by examining earnings and margins charts and compiled key profitability ratios, including ROE (using DuPont analysis), ROA, net income margins, and management efficiency ratios over the past 10 years. We then compare these metrics with those of the top 5 Canadian banks by assets. The analysis includes a breakdown of ROE using DuPont based on asset turnover, equity multiplier and net margin.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
Based on the table, BNS has a 10-year average ROE of 12.3%, which is lower than its major competitors, with Royal Bank of Canada leading at 14.9%, followed by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 14.0%, and Toronto-Dominion Bank at 13.1%. Based on DuPont, BNS's lower ROE is primarily due to its lower asset turnover (2.5%) compared to RBC (3.0%) and its slightly lower equity multiplier (16.1) compared to CIBC (19.1) and RBC (17.1).
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
In terms of Asset Turnover (Revenue / Assets), BNS has a 10-year average of 2.5%, which is the lowest compared to its competitors, such as RBC (3.0%) and BMO (2.8%). The reason is that its revenue, compared to its asset base, is the lowest compared to its competitors, indicating that the company is less efficient than its competitors at generating revenue per $ of asset. We believe one of the reasons for its lower efficiency is due to its large number of branches, it has around 3,000 branches worldwide. This translates to an average revenue per branch of CAD 10.8 mln, which is the lowest among the top 5 Canadian banks, which has an average revenue per branch of CAD 26.4 mln. In terms of Equity Multiplier (Asset / Equity), BNS has a 10-year average of 16.1, which is the lowest compared to its competitors, such as CIBC (19.1). The reason is that its equity, compared to its asset base, is relatively high compared to its competitors, indicating that the company has fewer liabilities and higher equity relative to its asset base.
The net margin of BNS is 30.7% is relatively strong compared to its peers, indicating that the bank is efficient at converting revenue into profit.
In terms of ROA, BNS has a 10-year average of 0.8%, which is on par with TD and RBC but slightly lower than the leading banks.
Moreover, in terms of management efficiency (measured by the non-interest expense to revenue ratio), BNS has a ratio of 54.4%, which is better than BMO (59.0%) and CIBC (60.0%), indicating stronger cost control, but slightly worse than RBC (53.2%). We also compiled its Management Efficiency (Non-interest Exp/Revenue) below for a better comparison of profitability margins between BNS and its competitors.

Based on the table above, BNS's Management Efficiency ranks 3rd compared to its competitors. Still, its management efficiency is significantly better than BMO (59%) and CIBC (60%), indicating that its non-interest expense relative to revenue is better than BMO and CIBC. Furthermore, BNS's Management Efficiency has been relatively stagnant from 2014 to 2021, averaging around 53.7% during this period. However, its Management Efficiency started to increase substantially from 53.2% in 2021 to 59.2% in 2023. Notably, all the banks above have seen a sudden increase in their Management Efficiency ratio in 2023.
Overall, we believe BNS has strong and decent profitability but lags some of its competitors. While its net margin is strong, its lower asset turnover and equity multiplier contribute to its slightly lower ROE compared to competitors. Thus, we believe BNS's profitability is good but not the strongest among the top Canadian banks.
Next, we examine the company's profitability trend in terms of earnings and margins, as shown in the chart below.


Based on the chart above, the company's profitability margins have been strong for the past 10 years. During this period, its EBIT margins have averaged 40.0%, while its net margins have averaged 30.7%. However, there is a slight decreasing trend for its operating and net margins.
We also compile each geographical region by net income margins for a better analysis of its region's profitability.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
Based on the table above, the US has the highest net income margins among its operating regions, at 37.4%, followed by Chile (31.1%), and Canada (29.7%). Mexico, Peru, the Caribbean and Central America, Other International net margins are also fairly in line with each other, these regions' margins hover between the low-20s to mid-20s net margin range. Notably, Columbia's net margins are the lowest among all other regions at 2.8%, which is due to the negative margins incurred during 2020 and 2023, whereby the region incurred higher provisions for credit losses and non-interest expenses relative to revenue. Moreover, its non-Canada weighted average net income breakdown is 11.4% in comparison to Canada's net income contribution (16.0%), highlighting that Canada's net income contribution is higher than its international segment.
Overall, we believe the company does not have a profitability advantage compared to its top peers. We expect the company's profitability margins to continue facing downward pressure as highlighted by their declining trend from 32.9% in 2014 to 26% in Q2 TTM. This is as we expect the company's growth to continue to be driven by its higher growth international segments, which we analyzed have a lower profitability margin compared to Canada except for Chile and the US. Furthermore, the company highlighted that besides Canada, the ""Pacific Alliance region continues to be our primary strategic focus"", which could bode negatively for its profit margins. Therefore, we expect the company's profitability metrics, such as ROE to remain lower than competitors due to the pressure on its net margin which negatively affects its ROE.
Finally, we examine the bank's financial strength by analyzing its capital adequacy ratios (Tier 1 and Total CAR), liquidity ratios (LCR and LDR), asset quality ratios (NPL, loan loss, coverage ratios), and its probability of default using a banking z-score, comparing these factors with those of other leading Canadian banks.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
Based on the table above, the company has the highest non-performing loans (NPL) at 0.87% of total loans, indicating that it has a worse asset quality compared to its peers. We believe one factor could be due to the company's geographic exposure, as in Latin America, Caribbean, and Central America NPL % the company's total NPL is 70% with the remainder 25% in Canada.
Source: Fitch, Trading Economics, Khaveen Investments
We analyze the credit ratings by Fitch, S&P and Moody's above to explain the higher NPL of the company's international loans. Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico scored BBB, A-, BB+, and BBB- on Fitch respectively. This is in contrast to Canada and the US, which both scored AA+ on Fitch. Moreover, Fitch's Credit Ratings highlighted that BBB is indicative of ""Good credit quality"", and that ""expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate"", whereas AA is indicative of ""Very high credit quality"", and that ""expectations of very low default risk. They indicate a very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events"". Additionally, Peru, Chile, Columbia, and Mexico scored BBB-, A, BB+, and BBB on S&P respectively, as well as Baa1, A2, Baa2, and Baa2 on Moody's. In line with Fitch, these countries' credit ratings are worse than Canada and the US, where Canada and the US scored AAA and Aaa on S&P as well as AA+ and Aaa on Moody's respectively. Overall, we believe this highlights the lower credit quality of the international regions the company has been exposed to.
Furthermore, RBC and TD Bank have one of the lowest NPL ratios, at 0.44% and 0.46% respectively. BMO (0.57%) and CIBC (0.47%) also perform relatively compared to the company. However, its loan loss ratio of 5.9, loan loss reserves divided by its total loans, was around half of the average of 10.7, a lower loan loss ratio indicates less aggressive provisioning for loan losses, likely due to its high international impaired loans and lower credit ratings in those regions as mentioned previously. Furthermore, its provision coverage ratio is relatively in line with its competitors. A higher provision coverage ratio indicates more conservative provisioning compared to loan losses.

Based on the data in the table, BNS (Bank of Nova Scotia) shows solid liquidity, with a 10-year average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 126.9%. This is only slightly lower than some of its peers, like Bank of Montreal (131.9%) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (129.7%). In terms of the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), BNS has a ratio of 79.6%, which is higher than that of Royal Bank of Canada (69.9%) but comparable to its peers. A higher LDR suggests that BNS is lending a higher portion of its deposits, which could be seen as taking on more risk. Overall, the company's LCR and LDR are fairly in line with the average, indicating decent liquidity in comparison with top Canadian banks.
Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments
Based on the table above, the company's Tier 1 CAR has averaged 12.9% over the past 10 years and is slightly lower than peers but still fairly in line, whereas TD Bank (13.9%) and BMO (13.6%) are the highest. Furthermore, its total CAR ratio of 14.9% is fairly in line with its peers. The CAR ratio is calculated as risk-weighted assets divided by total assets. Thus, both these ratios indicate that the company has a decent buffer to absorb losses against unexpected financial liquidity issues. Notably, the company's Tier 1 CAR and Total CAR are fairly in line with the average.
Overall, we believe that the firm has a decent financial position among the top Canadian banks, with robust Liquidity and Capital Adequacy. However, we believe it is weaker than its top competitors in terms of asset quality, it has the highest NPL % among its competitors, whereby its NPL % is close to double that of its competitors, highlighting its lower asset quality compared to other banks. The company highlighted the rationale for focusing on the Pacific Alliance countries is due to its ""strategic review of the region"" as well as ""attractive economic fundamentals and growth prospects"". For example, ""the Alliance has 208m people, and accounts for almost 40 percent of the GDP of the region, and 50 percent of trade"". Furthermore, BNS's head of international banking highlighted the ""relative political stability, good monetary fundamentals, good foreign reserves"" as attractive factors for expanding in the Pacific Alliance countries. This is also because the company noted that the Pacific Alliance offers ""excellent opportunities for growth with pro-business policies, favourable demographics, good economic growth, low consumer indebtedness and stable banking systems"". However, we believe its focus on these emerging markets carries a higher risk, as its high NPL % is affected by its internationally impaired loan exposure and lower credit rating in emerging markets, whereby Latin America, Caribbean, and Central America NPL % total NPL is 70%. Furthermore, its Loan Loss Ratio is also lower than its peers but fairly in line with the average, likely due to its international exposure.
That said, in terms of liquidity, the company's Liquidity Coverage Ratio is slightly below its peers but still shows solid liquidity. Additionally, its Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) is comparable to peers. In terms of capital adequacy, the company's Tier 1 CAR and Total CAR are fairly in line with its peers, which indicates that the company has a decent buffer to absorb losses against unexpected financial liquidity issues.
We believe one of the risks that could negatively impact the Bank of Nova Scotia would be the high competition with the other top 2 banks, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion Bank. In terms of market share, RBC's market share has been steady across the last 10 years and is currently the market leader in 2023 with a 24.6% market share, with TD Bank currently having the 2nd highest market share. Moreover, RBC and TD Bank's respective revenue CAGR of 5.7% and 6.0% is around 50% higher than that of the company (3.5%), which highlights that despite its international banking growth and geographical diversification benefit. Thus, we believe that its competition with the top 2 banks would negatively impact the company.
Overall, while we believe the company is one of the top banks in Canada, we believe it trails behind other top banks due to factors such as its lower growth performance, lower profitability in certain metrics and asset quality position. We believe the company does not exhibit a significant competitive advantage in terms of growth with a CAGR of 3.5%, lagging behind competitors like CIBC (6.7%) and BMO (6.2%). However, we recognize its strength in geographical diversification, with the highest percentage of non-Canada revenue among competitors at 57%, and non-Canada, non-US revenue at 39.6%, surpassing RBC's 15.9%. This diversification is beneficial, particularly given the higher loan growth rate (9.1%) and interest income percentage (5.4%) in its international banking segment compared to its Canadian operations.
In terms of profitability, we do not believe the company has a superior position among top Canadian banks. Its ROE of 12.3% is the second lowest, significantly trailing leaders like RBC (14.9%) and CIBC (14.0%). Despite having the highest equity multiplier and net margins, its low asset turnover negatively impacts its ROE. Additionally, while its management efficiency ranks 3rd among peers and has been improving, its net income margins have been declining, from 32.29% in 2014 to 26.43% TTM.
Financially, we believe the company's financial position is not as strong as its top competitors due to lower asset quality, liquidity, and capital adequacy rankings. The company maintains a decent position with robust liquidity and capital adequacy, but it falls short in asset quality. Its NPL percentage is nearly double that of competitors, largely due to international impaired loan exposure in regions like Latin America, the Caribbean, and Central America, where 70% of its NPLs are concentrated. Although its loan loss ratio is aligned with the average, the international exposure has worsened its asset quality.

Overall, we believe the factors analyzed including its relatively underperforming growth track record compared to top peers and its moderately declining profitability, are negative for equity investors in the company and thus rate the stock as a Hold. However, in terms of fixed income, we believe its strong financial position with robust liquidity management and capital adequacy are positives for the stability outlook of the firm and believe its fixed income securities are relatively more attractive than equity and therefore rate its fixed income securities as a Buy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731339-park-hotels-and-resorts-if-it-is-too-good-to-be-true-it-probably-is,4731339,"Park Hotels & Resorts: If It Is Too Good To Be True, It Probably Is","Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK) was formed in January 2017 after a spin-off from Hilton Worldwide. The company's portfolio consists of a total of approximately 43 hotels and 26k rooms across the United States. As of FY2023, the company's portfolio top three biggest markets by rooms are Hawaii, New York, and New Orleans.


Although PK is trading at a huge discount from its net asset value, it is important to note that the company is facing a slew of problems. In this report, I will demonstrate why investors should not be deceived by the company's net asset value and the company's current share price is overvalued.
In 3Q24, PK generated $649 million, representing a year-on-year decline of 4.4% and missing market expectations of $816.40k. On a year-on-year basis, total RevPAR surged by 3.8% while adjusted EBITDA declined by 2.5% from $163 million the same period last year to $159 million. Deterioration in revenue is attributable to weakness in multiple key markets. RevPAR in Hawaii, California, and Key West fell by 2.9%, 4.6% and 11.6% respectively. During this period, the company repurchased 2.5 million of shares and paid out $0.25 per share in dividends.
Unfortunately, for FY2024, the company has pulled its guidance due to uncertainty around the company's ongoing negotiations with labor unions. PK will provide a revised outlook once the agreements have been finalized.
PK's largest portfolio exposure is in Hawaii, taking up more than 12% of the company's total rooms. Historically, the Japanese represents one of the largest groups that visit Hawaii. However, since Covid-19 and the significant weakening of the yen, the number of tourists from Japan has plunged considerably. Currently, the number of Japanese visitors are still 50% below the pre-pandemic.


The strength of the yen will play a key factor in supporting the recovery of Hawaii's inbound travel from Japan. Unfortunately, the yen is likely to stay weak in the near future given that policymakers and the government remains slightly dovish.


Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba have recently stated that the country is not ready for an additional interest rate hike. This dovish view is further echoed by one of Bank of Japan's board members, Asahi Noguchi. In a recent speech, Asahi Noguchi mentioned that the Japanese economy is at a critical point and Japanese consumers will require more time to adjust. In addition, Bank of Japan's governor has stated that the economy will still require more time to achieve a sustainable 2% inflation, suggesting a dovish stance on monetary policy. Moreover, with Japan's Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito coalition losing the majority seats in the lower house, we should expect further uncertainty in the Japanese economy.
Ever since the company spin off in 2017, PK has disposed close to 43 hotels to reshape and improve its portfolio. Investors should not expect to see any growth coming from PK as the company continue to focus on downsizing its portfolio, sacrificing growth and optimize its return on investments. More importantly, investors should note that the company's strategy going forward is to continue disposing assets and use these proceeds to pay its liabilities; any surplus after liabilities will be returned to investors through share repurchase or dividends.


In other words, revenue growth will also likely deteriorate unless the company can improve its RevPAR faster than its disposals to offset any potential loss in value. According to CBRE, RevPAR is expected to grow 3% per year. Unfortunately, even if we assume a RevPAR growth of 5%, my analysis suggests that total revenues will still deteriorate if PK disposes 3 hotels a year.
Although PK does not have any substantial debt obligations for FY2024 and FY2025, the company will be required to pay down approximately $1.63 billion worth of debt maturities by FY2026. However, it is important to note that the company does not have sufficient cash flows to cover these obligations.


Thus far, PK have sold approximately 43 hotels for $3 billion, indicating an average value of about $70 million per hotel. If we assume the following: (1) PK sells 9 hotels between FY2024 and FY2026, (2) maintains all of its current margins and (3) generates a cashflow of $200 million per year, the company will only be able to raise $1.2 billion. In other words, the company will be required to utilize its current cash reserves of $480 million, wiping out the company's liquidity completely.


That being said, the core assumption is that PK will be able to generate $200 million per year (same value as per FY2023). However, in FY2023, the company experienced an anomaly with a CFO to Net Income of 5.19x. In the past five years, PK's CFO to Net Income is closer to 2x. If we utilize CFO to Net Income of 2x, the company will only be able to generate about $436 million between FY2024 and FY2026, indicating the company will not have enough cash to cover its obligations.
Although the company is able to refinance and tap on its credit facilities, it is very clear that the company does not have the means to repay its obligations from its operations and disposals. To put it simply, shareholders should not expect to see huge distributions and returns either through share repurchase or dividends.
Based on the following assumptions: (1) PK sells an average rate of 3 hotels per year, (2) maintains its current margins, (3) able to maintain a CFO to Net Income ratio of 2x, and (4) a WACC and generous terminal growth of 7.29% and 3%, my valuation model suggests that the implied share price is $8.22. Currently, PK is trading $13.86 per share, suggesting an overvaluation of close to 70%.
Of course, the above valuation is based on the company's ability to generate cash flows. Currently, company is trading at a huge discount to its book value; PK has a book value per share of $17.71. However, it is important to highlight the company's book value may not fully reflect the actual market value of the company's assets; after all, the valuation of the PK's assets is based on internal assessment. Investors should exercise caution if they are utilizing this metric to make a decision.
Overall, although PK looks attractive due to its disparity between the current share price and its book value per share, investors should also consider other factors. PK is facing other challenges such as: (1) weak outlook, (2) deteriorating growth, and (3) potential inability to cover its obligations. As always, if something is too good to be true, it probably is.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731330-china-october-manufacturing-pmi-returned-to-expansion,4731330,China's October Manufacturing PMI Returned To Expansion,"By Lynn Song
China's PMI beat expectations with an uptick to 50.1 in October, which marked the first expansion since April and marked a six-month high. The 50.1 level is the smallest possible expansion for the PMI but nonetheless bucks expectations for continued contraction, and is a positive sign that the small bounceback of industrial production that we saw in September could continue.
Looking at the subindices, there are some signs that the domestic situation could be seeing a gradual improvement. The production subindex hit a six-month high of 52.0, and new orders also returned to a neutral state of 50.0 after contracting the previous five months. While still in contraction, employment (48.4 up from 48.2), purchases (49.3 up from 47.6), imports (47.0 up from 46.1), and backlog of orders (45.4 up from 44.0) also saw smaller declines compared to last month.
However, we continued to see that new export orders saw a further decline on the month, down to an eight-month low of 47.3. The downward trend from the last few months appears to signal that external demand continues to weaken; this aspect was one of the main drivers behind a stronger-than-expected performance of manufacturing for much of 2024.
The overall improvement was driven by large enterprises (51.5 up from 50.6) and medium-sized enterprises (49.4 up from 49.2), while small enterprises (47.5 from 48.5) worsened on the month.
Moving forward, we'll need to see if the stimulus rollout can lead to a recovery of domestic demand to offset potentially softer external demand picture, which could be even less favourable if we do see a Trump victory next week and a subsequent escalation of tariffs.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731334-airbus-vs-boeing-blossoming-ai-opportunity-versus-bad-corporate-culture,4731334,Airbus Vs. Boeing: Blossoming AI Opportunity Versus Bad Corporate Culture,"In late 2023, I wrote an article about the opportunities in front of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY) based on the companies’ development of autonomous flight, and I rated both a “buy” because of the rewards that the companies could reap from autonomy. While Airbus’s autonomy progress is on track, Boeing’s whole business has suffered setback after setback.
In this article, I will revise my long-term thesis on Boeing, and account for an aspect of the company that I should have considered from the beginning: Boeing’s corporate culture. I will also update and reaffirm my thesis on Airbus.
In the beginning, Boeing was a company focused on building high-quality planes. For decades, this is what it did, and it did this well. Boeing was a large company for many years, but it did not behave like an ordinary company.
Before the 1990s, the culture at Boeing was very engineering-centric. The people in charge of the company obviously cared a good deal about ensuring the business was sustainable, but they cared more about the quality of the products Boeing put out. Boeing had a reputation for quality engineering, a reputation that generated a memorable slogan about the company and its aircraft: “If it ain’t Boeing, I ain’t going!”
From the company’s participation in WWII producing bombers for the US military (e.g. the B-17, B-19, and B-52), to the company’s creation of the arguably revolutionary 707 aircraft, Boeing was trusted to make planes far and wide, before expanding into spacecraft and beyond. Even during Boeing’s difficult period in the 1970s, quality was paramount at the company.
In 1992, Philip Condit became chairman of Boeing, and then CEO in 1996. Under Condit, Boeing moved its headquarters away from Seattle, its engineering hub. Many say this was the beginning of the problems at Boeing, arguing that the move separated Boeing’s management from its engineers and imperiled the company’s engineering-centric corporate culture. But the Seattle move was in 2001; Boeing’s culture had been under threat for years by then.
Back in 1997, Boeing purchased the recently struggling plane maker and defense contractor McDonnell Douglas. To really understand how things got bad at Boeing, one should understand how things got bad at McDonnell.
McDonnell Douglas had been a well-known and respectable aerospace firm until it started running into trouble in the 1980s. In 1989, CEO John McDonnell instituted the Total Quality Management System, or TQMS, that fundamentally reshaped how engineers were allowed to work on aircraft at the company. It resulted in disruption to 5000 managerial jobs and the net loss of around 2200 management positions, and dealt a big blow to company morale. Demoralized employees supposedly came up with their own meaning for the TQMS: “Time to Quit and Move to Seattle”, the home of Boeing at the time. A layoff of 20,000 workers to cut costs and increase profitability came soon after, further degrading morale.
This is likely where problems started within McDonnell Douglas, as the implementation of the TQMS signaled that a profit-focused, management-dominated culture was being injected into the company. True, the company had been struggling with profitability since the merger of McDonnell Aircraft and Douglas Aircraft, but its decision to address profitability by utilizing top-down managerial strategies to boost efficiency and trim costs, instead of relying on bottom-up engineering expertise, was not the best long-term solution.
In any case, the focus on profit and efficiency combined with removing engineers’ agency coincided with a difficult market environment and continued operational struggles for the company during the 1990s – struggles that opened the door for a merger/buyout of the company by Boeing. However, Boeing was setting itself up to inherit the problems inherent in McDonnell Douglas's corporate culture, largely due to McDonnell Douglas’s executives taking a great degree of control of Boeing after the merger.
After Boeing CEO Condit’s departure, former McDonnell Douglas CEO Harry Stonecipher took the reins at Boeing in 2003. Stonecipher was reportedly influenced by Jack Welch, who famously (or infamously) sought profit, efficiency, and workforce reduction wherever it could be found. Under Welch’s leadership, General Electric (GE) experienced a boom in market cap, but then suffered a fall in financial and product outcomes as well as its reputation in the years after Welch's retirement.
Stonecipher and the Boeing/McDonnell executives who followed the Welch-esque profit-focused corporate style took Boeing down a similar path. Without the influence of Boeing's engineers in Seattle, Boeing's management was undeterred in focusing on cost cuts and efficiency; as a result, production workers and managers cut corners while designing, developing, and building Boeing’s product lines. That strategy may have paid off in the short-to-medium term, but it's easy to see why it rarely ends well long-term.
Such a radical departure in Boeing's approach to management and engineering prompted many observers to grimly note that Boeing's ethos was apparently replaced with McDonnell Douglas's during the merger, especially with McDonnell management largely taking over the new firm. Hence, many say that McDonnell became the true surviving company, and that ""McDonnell Douglas was so cheap, they bought Boeing with Boeing’s own money.""
Logically, then, after nearly three decades, the Boeing-McDonnell merger is now being blamed for many of Boeing’s managerial and financial problems in recent years. The merger’s effects have been used to explain the Boeing 737 Max crisis, Boeing's failures with its Starliner spacecraft, and the change in corporate culture that led to Boeing’s overall decline in product quality.
Boeing today is suffering in both its reputation and financials, largely thanks to its McDonnell Douglas-influenced culture. Surprisingly, the full weight of the consequences of this new culture is only now bearing down on the company.
Just a year ago (per the Q3’23 earnings call), Boeing was expecting $10 billion in free cash flow between 2025 and 2026. But in the Q3'24 earnings call a week ago, the CFO confirmed that the company expects Boeing's free cash flow to be negative in 2025, and that 2025's negative FCF will be ""significantly better"" than 2024's FCF (which is a pretty grim preview of Boeing's full 2024 profitability numbers).
Based on management’s statements, it’s safe to say that last year’s guidance of $10 billion in FCF for 2025-26 is probably out of reach now. Considering the issues the company is facing, it’s understandable why:
On top of all of this, Boeing is not profitable, and has not been since 2018, the year of its last positive net income. The company has been running on debt ever since, and cash reserves total a bit north of $10 billion at time of writing; trailing 12 month [TTM] net losses were nearly $8 billion, indicating just over a year of runway left at the current burn rate. But even if Boeing was operating at breakeven, the company has over $11 billion in debt coming due by 2026, which is more than its cash balance. With all these problems, it’s no wonder that Boeing’s credit rating is just shy of junk bond territory, making BA nearly a fallen angel stock.
All is not lost, though. On October 28th, Boeing announced that it will raise about $20 billion in capital via strategic share issuance. $20 billion in new capital will not wipe out Boeing’s problems, but it will provide the company some valuable cushion to address its financial woes, and in the best case, this raise, if successful, may reduce the need for the other bulleted remedies above, most of which could be quite painful for Boeing and its stakeholders. Still, this does not change the fact that Boeing’s financial situation is currently quite dire, and far from resolved long-term.
In short, Boeing’s finances are essentially in shambles, and the company is scrambling to fix them.
As far as BA’s valuation goes, many metrics aren’t applicable to Boeing, since it generates no profit and its finances are in a state of flux. BA’s Price to Sales ratio is ~1.35, discounted a bit to the industrials sector’s ratio of ~1.5. But valuing shares of a company in financial trouble is difficult, and ultimately, BA’s value will only become clear after Boeing addresses its financial issues and its corporate culture.
My 2023 article on Boeing and Airbus, titled Boeing, Airbus, And The Autonomous Aircraft Opportunity, focused on the benefits that autonomous flight would bring to the two plane makers if they could capitalize on it. A critical part of my thesis focused on benefits of autonomy that are not directly financial in nature:
What I failed to account for in that analysis is that Boeing’s corporate culture could delay or derail its progress toward developing its autonomous flight software, along with degrading its reputation and harming Boeing’s product quality and product sales. Autonomous flight may be critical in securing Boeing’s place in aerospace, but high product quality, a good reputation, and solid finances are also critical, and Boeing is now lacking in all three.
Assuming that Boeing’s autonomy is still on track and hasn’t been negatively affected by its leadership decisions, the company’s current trajectory implies that even autonomy won’t be enough to save the plane maker. Sure it still has a backlog now, but for how long? Will Boeing's new CEO Kelly Ortberg be able to quickly and effectively shift this giant company's entire corporate culture before other plane makers try to take its place in the airplane oligopoly?
On the matter of competitors, Airbus is arguably pulling ahead of Boeing in plane deliveries, and is already ahead of Boeing in autonomous flight development (which I will address later in this article). How long before it takes an insurmountable lead against Boeing? How will it take for a competitor like Embraer (ERJ) to invest in the infrastructure and machinery needed to make the planes Boeing does, and at the same volume and quality Boeing used to? And beyond that, how long until Embraer independently unlocks fully autonomous flight? The company has already put together autonomous takeoff software, in addition to pre-existing autonomous landing software. Those two capabilities encompass 1 of the 3 necessary elements of flying completely autonomously (which I will review in the Airbus section), and Embraer is not standing still after recent autonomy achievements either. The company has produced a concept for a fully autonomous passenger plane, and while it may be several years before any such plane is produced by the company, Boeing will be distracted putting out fires while Embraer focuses on making its autonomy dreams a reality. Is it possible that not just Airbus, but also Embraer, both realize their autonomy plans before Boeing does?
There are too many unknowns when it comes to both Boeing and its competition, and I'm not sure that the prospect of fully autonomous flight in Boeing craft can make up for them. The Boeing AI/autonomy thesis isn’t necessarily broken, but the long-term Boeing “buy” thesis is.
The only notable risk to my new Boeing thesis is that CEO Kelly Ortberg will aggressively change Boeing’s corporate culture back to one centered on engineering excellence, while shoring up the company’s finances, boosting its product quality and encouraging the continued development of autonomous flight software for wide deployment in Boeing aircraft, all while preserving as many business lines as possible. If Ortberg is able to do all this, then the current low point for the company and its stock will have been an opportunity to buy the dip and hold for the long term.
Unfortunately, it all seems to be riding on Ortberg, and until we have more clarity on what he does and how successful he is, all we can do is wait and see for now.
Per an early-October report, Airbus’s A350-1000 aircraft has demonstrated the ability to reliably automate some of the hardest parts of flying – taxiing, takeoffs, and landings. This feat has been several years in the making, since the A350’s software has been doing test flights since at least 2020.
As of September 2024, Airbus’s official orders and deliveries page (opens in excel) shows orders of the A350-1000 totaling over 300 planes, and deliveries of 88 planes so far this year. In other words, Airbus is actively commercializing a big piece of autonomous flight today, and is reaping the ever-growing rewards of it with every passing month, and with each new incident-free delivery, and with each incident-free flight performed mostly autonomously.
To be fair, the A350-1000 does have a few problems with faulty engine components, but that’s a hardware issue – Airbus’s A350 software has generated no complaints or concerns among Airbus’s customers that I am aware of. The Airbus autonomy thesis therefore remains intact, as Airbus is executing on its ""autonomous"" software deployment seemingly without incident.
But even with the impressive feats of the A350-1000's flights, Airbus's autonomy isn't complete just yet. As I noted in my previous piece last year:
It is only the third Airbus autonomy offering, ATTOL, that allows the company's A350-1000 planes to perform their current ""autonomous"" feats. Once the other Airbus software's capabilities are folded into Airbus's ATTOL-enabled craft, the company will unequivocally achieve full autonomy. To that end, the deployment of ATTOL-enabled aircraft with no software-related complaints is a major stepping stone, and indicates that Airbus is well on its way to establishing full autonomy in its products.
Both Boeing and Airbus are still recovering from supply chain issues caused by the pandemic shutdowns in 2020, with Airbus apparently struggling to gather enough engines to finish building its planes this year. Despite this, Airbus's supply chain issues are a breeze next to the multiple crises happening at Boeing.
With help from its semi-autonomous aircraft deliveries, Airbus’s financials are displaying appealing resilience. Airbus’s Q3’24 earnings report has just been released, so I crunched the company’s TTM numbers by adding the consolidated 9-month numbers in the Q3’24 report to the quarterly numbers from Q4’23.
Airbus’s revenue has risen to ~$74 billion TTM, up a bit from $72.2 billion for the fiscal/full year 2023 [FY23], a small but noteworthy increase year-over-year. TTM net income is ~$3.5 billion, down from $4.1 billion for FY23, a slight decline in profitability. In absolute terms, Airbus saw a ~$2 billion revenue bump, but with a $600 million net income decline in the past year.
Compare those numbers to Boeing’s: from FY23 to TTM, Boeing’s revenue fell from $77.7 billion to $73.2 billion, and net income fell from losses of -$2.2 billion to -$7.9 billion. Boeing lost $4.5 billion in revenue and added $5.7 billion in net losses in the past year; all things considered, Airbus’s operations are running quite smoothly and quite profitably.
As for Airbus shares’ valuation, Seeking Alpha provides the following data:


P/E for EADSF/EADSY shares is at a 10-60% premium, depending on accounting method and earnings horizon; P/S is at a premium of less than 10%; P/B is more than double the sector ratio; and P/Cash flow is 78-400% of the sector, depending on earnings horizon.
Most valuation metrics show that EADSF/EADSY is trading at a premium, either a large one or a small one depending on one’s preferred metric. As far as I’m concerned, the premium is justified – Airbus is one of a handful of aircraft companies, and likely the first major plane maker, to sell large commercial aircraft with significant autonomous capabilities. As I said in my previous article, fully autonomous flight will likely be mandated in the future to curb human error, so the company is going a long way toward future-proofing its business by deploying incident-free semi-autonomous craft now.
With Boeing’s issues on full display, it’s possible that only Airbus will be trusted by aerospace customers to deliver autonomous aircraft in the next few years. Those customers who purchase Airbus’s A350-1000 and other autonomous Airbus craft may develop an affinity for the company’s products for many years afterward. In time, these customers' positive experiences with Airbus products may even prompt them to designate Airbus their go-to autonomous craft supplier, solidifying Airbus’s position in the market. Buying EADSF/EADSY stock ahead of this virtuous cycle would benefit long-term aerospace investors, especially since the cycle will intensify when Airbus announces that it makes products that are fully autonomous and pilotless.
Risks to Airbus include continued supply chain issues and raised interest rates. Supply chain issues will cap the rate at which Airbus can produce planes; meanwhile, high interest rates may cap consumer demand for flights as well as increase expenses for airlines, which would cap airline revenues and demand for planes, which would hinder Airbus’s plane sales.
Another risk to Airbus is that it undergoes a negative change in its corporate culture, like Boeing did. While this risk doesn’t appear to be on the horizon, Boeing proves it is a risk that cannot be ignored. If the last 30 years at Boeing has taught us anything, it’s that bad corporate governance can lead to bad products and bad financials.
Yet another risk is that Airbus's products disappoint customers or otherwise underperform. This would eliminate the possible virtuous cycle that would get customers to be more loyal to Airbus and settle in to buying its products exclusively.
The last risk is that Airbus is unable to, or struggles to, complete its autonomous software, e.g. by making it capable of independent obstacle avoidance and planning for unpredictable scenarios. Failure or delay in this effort would allow others, including Boeing and Embraer, to catch up in producing full autonomy software and fully autonomous aircraft before Airbus, reducing its competitive advantage in the long term.
A year ago, I rated shares of both BA and EADSF/EADSY as long-term ""buys"" due to the fully autonomous flight software the two companies were preparing to develop and deploy in their aircraft. Airbus’s bullish story remains unchanged, but until we see some fundamental changes in how Boeing's management operates, as well as a change in the company’s financial situation, a medium-term ""hold"" is more appropriate for the American plane maker.
Boeing’s long-term future in the age of autonomous flight is still taking shape, and since past mistakes by the company have both damaged and clouded its future, I cannot rate Boeing on a long-term basis at this time. On balance, I think selling BA shares would be premature, as the company could bounce back over the next few years. However, I think investors would be best served by keeping spare capital on the sidelines, at least until Boeing shows signs of a sustained recovery and improved corporate governance.
By contrast, Airbus’s future in autonomous flight looks bright, and its stock is likely to benefit greatly as the aerospace industry and the stock market digest that new reality. I see little reason for investors to wait to buy shares in the European plane maker, even considering their valuation premium.
I therefore revise my rating on BA shares to a hold, and maintain my rating for EADSF/EADSY at a buy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731333-fs-kkr-capital-stock-quality-bdc-but-i-not-buying,4731333,"FS KKR Capital: Quality BDC, But I'm Not Buying","FS KKR Capital (NYSE:FSK), a business development company (BDC), has a sensitive portfolio position in the face of the (likely) proceeding interest rate decreases. However, there are a few aspects to consider when evaluating a BDC's capability to uphold dividend payments in a changing market environment.
For those unacquainted with the BDC term, these entities provide financing solutions to businesses struggling with acquiring more traditional financing sources (from banks or the public). They date back to 1980 when Congress authorized BDCs as a new business form due to a substantial deficit of financing possibilities for SMEs.
However, it's worth noting that BDCs' journeys didn't really launch until the late 1990s / early 2000s.
As of Q2 2024, the most secure financing instrument (senior secured loans—first lien debt) comprised ~58.1% of FSK's portfolio at fair value. The Company also had other debt investments, investments through its Credit Opportunities Partners joint venture (JV) (which invests in the range of debt and equity investments), and equity.
As of Q2 2024, the Company had 208 portfolio companies and 1.8% investments on non-accrual status at fair value. The portfolio is well-diversified across 24 industries with the software&services as the most prominent sector holding ~15.9% of the portfolio's fair value. The Top 10 investments concentration (excl. the abovementioned JV) amounted to ~20.3%.
FSK is pretty generous towards its shareholders, as the Company is capable of distributing not only regular dividends ($0.64 per share) but also some specials along the way, which range from $0.05 to $0.06 per share. It's worth noting that there used to be quarters when distributions totaled $0.75 per share, but FSK has recently announced that the distributions in Q4 2024 will amount to $0.70 per share.
Let's take a careful approach and analyze the safety of regular payments ($0.64 per share). Given that 68.8% of FSK's portfolio is sensitive to interest rate changes and the fact that we are already after one interest rate cut, investors should review their future income expectations in light of potential (likely) further cuts.
There are several factors to consider:
To provide you with an overview of FSK's dividend safety, I've decided to prepare a sensitivity analysis taking into account the last twelve months of FSK's Net Investment Income, its regular dividend payments, and the impact of interest rate changes.
With that in mind, FSK's regular DPS coverage amounted to ~120% as of June 2024. However, one has to remember that we already witnessed one interest rate cut, and there's likely more to come. Please review the table below for FSK's interest rate sensitivity analysis and potential income on regular/base dividend coverage.
With no other conditions changes, FSK's current coverage (including the cut in September 2024) amounted to ~115%. Nevertheless, I believe that shareholders will benefit from some additional payments along the way - at least until we approach a further 150 bps cut, which would constitute a 325 - 350 level. For reference, please review the market predictions of interest rate levels a year from now. The market anticipates the abovementioned level (or lower) to occur one year from now with ~40% probability.
As an M&A advisor, I usually rely on a multiple valuation method that is a leading tool in transaction processes, as it allows for accessible and market-driven benchmarking.
As we have a BDC on the discussion today, let's look at its P/BV ratio.
FSK's price-to-book value ratio has a history of relatively stable levels (the spike in mid-2021 is likely a technical error). While many investors may consider such valuation opportunistic, as the Company trades at a discount to its net asset value, I'm a bit wary of that, especially given that it's been the case for years now.
The higher the premium, the more proceeds you can generate with a given magnitude of stock issues, which is not the case for BDCs that tend to trade at a discount. Therefore, a seemingly attractive valuation can be a double-edged sword when it comes to a BDC.
FSK can certainly be considered a quality BDC. However, I don't currently have it in my portfolio, and I don't intend to initiate a position in the near term. I believe there are some more attractive BDCs to focus on in the current market environment, which offer similar qualities with better dividend coverage.
Nevertheless, there are certainly some cons when it comes to FSK, which include:
To conclude, FSK is a 'hold' for me that can benefit its current shareholders. Please take into account your expected yield-on-cost when evaluating investment opportunities, especially in the BDC sector.
Each stock market investment carries market and business-specific risk factors, which in the case of FSK include:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731332-blackline-is-expanding-net-profit-margins-fast,4731332,BlackLine Is Expanding Net Profit Margins Fast,"The average investor might confuse BlackLine, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL) with BlackRock or Blackstone. Easy to do. Many finance firms have similar names. However BlackLine is very different from the typical finance investment firm. In fact, it is a software business focused on financial automation for enterprise customers. Think Quickbooks but for firms with +1,000 employees.


BlackLine was founded in 2001 by Therese Tucker, who is a fantastic founder-CEO. She bootstrapped the business for 12 years before raising $200m from Silver Lake Partners, one of the most notable technology investment firms on the Street.
I first learned about Therese three years ago when Jason Lemkin interviewed her on the SaaStr podcast. Jason interviews a wide range of the best software CEOs. He's best known for selling EchoSign to Adobe. Most of his content is free and very educational for savvy tech investors.
In the video linked above, Therese discusses the challenges of dealing with black swan events. Investors face the risk of a black swan event with their own portfolios. However you don't think about it much when it comes to operating a company.
Even in BlackLine's case, unexpected events can have a significant impact on a business. Tucker says that the key to dealing with these events is to be nimble and to have a cash buffer. She also says that it is important to look for opportunities in these events, as they can be a chance to build goodwill with customers.
This is the perfect place for us to begin.
BlackLine's primary customer base are midsize and enterprise organizations across various industries. Their buyer profile is very specific. Think the Office of the CFO, which includes accounting and finance professionals focused on improving financial reporting. BlackLine is focused on automating the financial close with great software to reduce manual work.


BlackLine's pitch is that better financial software will accelerate cash flows, which is what we investors want to hear. This means focusing on intercompany transactions (accounting) and invoice-to-cash cycles (cash flows) problems.
If you are a savvy investor, then you need accurate financial data, on-time. If you run a massive company in multiple countries with +100 product lines, financial management is a big challenge. First, managing an educated team on how to report finances is hard; second is ensuring 100% financial accuracy. Getting company data across different departments is difficult, but transparency is essential if you are in a leadership role.
If you work in finance or accounting, chances are you use software like SAP and Oracle's NetSuite/Hyperion. Workday is another competitor that has made serious progress in financial management software. However none of these players specialize in automation workflows like BlackLine. This is a unique problem every company has and puts BlackLine in a unique category as a public company.


BlackLine is a ~$4 billion business focused on accounting problems. Think mission-critical software, which is boring yet very profitable. Before diving into the financials, let's look at the price. Right now, the stock is trending upwards from its summer low.


Financial accounting software has a very sticky customer base. And the stock price can fluctuate based on tax seasons. Which brings up the two types of trading events investors need to look out for right now: year-end taxes and the Presidential Election. Both will determine how much work BlackLine's clients need help with and when. More work = more money.
With the Election coming up, investors will look to rebalance portfolios before year-end (i.e. tax harvesting etc.). Which means everyone will be managing their finances but not realize what BlackLine's software is doing behind the scenes. Those same investors also probably don't have BlackLine on their watchlist so reading this article gives you a competitive advantage.
Earlier I mentioned a sticky customer base. BlackLine has continued to grow its revenue, year-over-year. In fact, 2023 was the first year the company was net profitable for the full year, and this trend has continued going into 2024.
Now in 2024, BlackLine has achieved 13% year-over-year increase in Q1 and Q2 with improved profitability. I think this trendline continues going into the year-end. Third quarter earnings will be released on Nov 7, 2024.


Now let's look into the financial highlights before diving into product and customer. BlackLine has healthy software metrics: 79% gross margins and 105% net revenue retention. Since the company achieved profitability with scale, both metrics indicate that customer expansion will be the next step.
For context, BlackLine has 4,400 customers today. They have achieved critical mass and the low-hanging-fruit in their industry. Acquiring new enterprise customers will take longer and be more expensive. So investors can expect revenue growth to stabilize around 10% going forward.


I love companies with detailed investor presentations. It suggests the team is very organized. Which makes sense for BlackLine because they specialize in financial automation?
One thing BlackLine does well is partner with accounting consulting firms like RSM. This works as an effective distribution strategy. It lowers the acquisition cost for BlackLine and produces longer-term client relationships.


The second element is the focus on digital self-service. Software companies with self-service features tend to have more touchpoints and lower costs per support ticket. Combining this with Generative AI has serious potential to improve net profit margins for BlackLine going forward.


Even with strong financials and high gross margins, investors need to be aware of portfolio risks. The obvious one is buying BlackLine stock, and it continues floating between $50-70. There is no strong incentive for the price to go beyond $100 in the near-term. Maybe in 5-6 years, but 3 years is unlikely at the current rate.
Not investing in high-flying tech stocks or even AI is a real opportunity cost. BlackLine doesn't have a dividend, so investors don't get paid to wait.
Speaking of AI, this is a serious threat in the software industry. Software once ate the world, but now AI is eating software. Last month another fintech startup, Klarna, announced they would replace Workday with AI. This was a bold claim. Personally, I think they are stretching it.
Right now, AI hallucinates too much. So AI can augment software, but it won't replace human productivity yet. AI is getting better and this is a threat to every software provider, even BlackLine. Their only advantage is to become the leader in generative AI to create their own solutions. If they are successful in doing this, BlackLine's net profit margins will increase. But this is optimistic. Right now, investors need to be aware of who and how software margins can be impacted by AI in the near term.
Blackline is one of those sleepy software stocks that falls under the radar for most investors. It sounds cool enough to invest in, but you don't really know what the company does. However, I think Blackline is an exception. It is a business with which investors are very familiar. Financial automation makes everyone's life easier.
So outside of a black swan event, BlackLine will continue trending in the right direction. Revenue will grow in the low-teens, and net profit margins will likely increase. The high net retention among enterprise customers creates high certainty for future revenue. Accounting and finance are mission-critical functions, so BlackLine will be one of the last contracts to cancel during a recession.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731342-consumer-priorities-drive-the-retail-outlook,4731342,Consumer Priorities Drive The Retail Outlook,"By Mari Shor
Despite a better-than-expected economic backdrop, consumers remain cautious. They are spending carefully, and more on services than goods. When they do spend on goods, there’s a general aversion to big ticket items like appliances, TVs and home furniture.
Inflation remains one of the main factors driving this caution. Even though overall inflation is down, food prices are still high, which is putting a crimp on discretionary spending.
This translates to consumer activity that is exceptionally concentrated on needs over wants, and around key discount periods like Black Friday and other holiday sales.
Another key economic factor affecting consumer spending is the labor market. As of now, the jobs picture remains stable, and real wages are slightly positive. While not an immediate concern in the next few months, the potential for a significant uptick in unemployment will be on the radar for retail-sector investors in 2025.

Source: Columbia Threadneedle Investments as of September 30, 2024.
We’re seeing a similar trend of caution on the supply side, with retailers managing inventories tightly. Retailers learned their lesson the hard way in 2022, when many found themselves burdened with excess stock.
More recently, the lulls in sales between Black Friday and Christmas week have been deeper than expected, which dragged down overall retail performance. We think this hot-and-cold pattern is likely to continue into this holiday season - and will keep the pressure on retailers to get the balance right.
Value and convenience remain dominant themes with consumers, and companies across the retail spectrum that can deliver both are likely going to do well - whether it’s building out a multi-vendor marketplace or improving delivery.
Within these themes, it gets very company-specific. We’re seeing a divergence of winners and losers even in strong-performing categories like beauty and athletic apparel. There are pockets of growth - in apparel, for instance, where fresh trends and innovation are resonating - but investors will need to be discerning.
Unsurprisingly, e-commerce is still outpacing brick-and-mortar growth. Non-store retail, which includes e-commerce, is growing in the high single to low-double digits, while traditional retail is growing in the low single digits.
It’s important to note that strong e-commerce growth is primarily driven by a handful of key players. Amazon (AMZN) alone accounts for nearly half of the non-store retail category.
It’s also notable that some specialty retailers are seeing more growth in their stores than online. And certain segments of apparel, home goods and even consumer electronics are also starting to see improvement - so it’s not monolithic.

Source: Columbia Threadneedle Investments as of September 30, 2024.
If current trends hold, retail will likely remain a highly fragmented, low single-digit growth category in the longer term, with value and convenience continuing to drive consumer choices. With no next big macro growth driver in sight, retailers will find themselves angling for limited market share.
With that in mind, we suggest that investors focus on established performers - like off-price retailers and the leading value and omni-channel players. And keep an eye out for companies that are able to deliver on promises of innovation, as well as turnaround names that have meaningful margin and cash flow expansion opportunities.

However, what's most impressive is how its active managers produced this alpha. Rather than leaning heavily into Technology stocks, PVAL allocates more to Financials, while maintaining healthy allocations to defensive stocks in the Consumer Staples and Health Care sectors. It's well-balanced at the sector level, which offsets some risks associated with highly concentrated funds. PVAL currently holds only 44 stocks.
Today, I will evaluate PVAL's fundamentals compared to FDVV, DGRW, the Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (CGDV), and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). While I am impressed with the fund's prior performance, I'm disappointed with its current composition, which lacks the earnings momentum it had earlier this year. To be sure, its 17.28x forward P/E is quite attractive, but I wouldn't be a buyer at this point, and instead, I encourage readers to consider alternatives until its fundamentals improve. I hope you enjoy the read.
PVAL is actively managed by Darren Jaroch and Lauren DeMore, two CFA charterholders with a combined 50 years of experience in the investment industry, including 43 with Putnam. Jaroch is the fund's Portfolio Manager, while DeMore brings experience as an analyst in the firm's equity research group, specifically covering the international financials, telecommunications, and utilities sectors. Their bios on PVAL's fund page note how both manage Putnam's U.S. Large Cap Value and Non-U.S. Value Equity strategies and according to the fund's prospectus document, managers ""may consider, among other factors, a company's valuation, financial strength, growth potential, competitive position in its industry, projected future earnings, cash flows and dividends when deciding whether to buy or sell investments.""
One distinguishing feature is that PVAL is a semi-transparent ETF, meaning that it does not disclose its holdings on a daily basis. The logic is to protect the firm's strategy, a decision I'm sure was carefully made while realizing most ETF investors would prefer full transparency. I would too, but at the same time, it's hard to argue with the fund's track record. As shown below, despite a relatively high 0.56% expense ratio, PVAL's 58.28% total return since its May 5, 2021, launch date was 6.06% and 8.40% better than FDVV and DGRW, two well-established funds that tend to allocate about one-quarter of their assets to Technology stocks. PVAL also outperformed SPY by 12.21% (58.28% vs. 46.07%), a result made possible by a substantial 15.57% beat in 2022.


Though I can't judge an ETF based on only three years of data, this data suggests PVAL can outperform in market downturns while capturing enough upside in bull markets to make it worth investors' while. One of the ways it's done this is by not venturing too deep into the value territory, carefully selecting stocks with attractive valuations but also with some growth potential. For example, its weighted average growth one-year estimated earnings per share growth rate was 7.26% at the start of October. This growth rate was consistent at 7.48% and 7.05% the two months prior and helped differentiate PVAL from high-yielding funds like the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), which, unsurprisingly, struggled in this growth-favored market. Not coincidentally, PVAL, FDVV, DGRW, and CGDV had growth rates in the top 30% of all large-cap value ETFs to begin the month, so from a factor perspective, it's easy to explain why they all performed well.
As a semi-transparent fund, I cannot say which securities the ETF currently holds. However, historical portfolio turnover rates are low for an actively managed fund, suggesting its managers have high conviction. Per its semi-annual report, PVAL's turnover rate for the six months ended February 29, 2024, was just 14%, and the annual turnover rates for the two full fiscal years prior were only 37% and 48%, respectively.


Given these low portfolio turnover rates, there's a good chance PVAL's holdings list as of September 30, 2024, is reasonably accurate. I've listed the top ten below, which total 33.60% of the portfolio. They include defensive stocks like Walmart (WMT) and Coca-Cola (KO), as well as some bank stocks like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC).


Please note, there are five stocks on PVAL's September 30, 2024, holdings list that are not listed in its tracking basket as of today. It's possible the following stocks, whose weights total 9.27% of the portfolio, were removed.
In addition, please consider the following sector allocation differences between PVAL, FDVV, DGRW, CGDV, and SPY. Again, I want to highlight PVAL's low 10.54% exposure to Technology stocks, a feature that likely led to its strong outperformance in 2022. You might find this composition favorable in the next market drawdown, though I think FDVV does a reasonably good job managing risk due to its unique ""barbell"" approach to stock selection, as discussed here.


The next table highlights selected fundamental metrics for PVAL's top 25 holdings, which total 70.14% on a cash-adjusted basis. At the bottom, I've also included summary metrics for FDVV, DGRW, CGDV, and SPY.


Here are three observations to consider:
1. PVAL's one-year estimated earnings per share growth rate has declined from 7.26% at the start of October to 5.75%. Furthermore, its 3.74% sales growth estimate suggests PVAL might be positioning for a value rotation. There's every chance this is the correct move, but this approach differs from what was previously employed and could backfire. In contrast, FDVV, DGRW, and CGDV offer higher growth rates, so I reason they will outperform if the bull run continues.
2. PVAL's 17.28x forward P/E is attractive and the best of the five funds listed. Furthermore, its 4.07/10 sector-adjusted value score, which I derived from individual Seeking Alpha Factor Grades, is just as good as FDVV and far better than DGRW and CGDV. Diversified Banks like Citigroup and Bank of America contribute positively to this score, while Consumer Staples stocks like Walmart are significant detractors. Walmart trades at 33.83x forward earnings and is trading close to its 52-week-high, so I'm curious as to why it's remained in the portfolio whereas alternatives like Target (TGT) have better value and growth features. Still, Walmart is a legacy holding for many investors, including myself, and I understand not shifting positions too often unless a clear opportunity presents itself.
3. A short-term headwind could be weak earnings revisions, evidenced by PVAL's 5.50/10 EPS Revision Score. The table above shows that Exxon Mobil (XOM) has the worst score of 1.00/10, representing an ""F"" Grade from Seeking Alpha. The trend is also negative for other top holdings like Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which missed sales expectations last quarter and delivered only a $0.03 Normalized EPS beat (0.57%) last week.


EPS Revisions are based on actual Wall Street consensus estimates, so I consider them objective and a reliable measure of market sentiment. While I don't expect managers to dump stocks just because they had a disappointing quarter, it makes sense to choose the fund with stronger earnings momentum, which is FDVV. Owning both could also work, as the two overlap by just 15.02%. PVAL also has a 17-18% overlap with DGRW and CGDV, so it seems like an efficient add for investors capable of managing multiple funds.
Lastly, PVAL's annual returns compared to FDVV and DGRW were nearly identical over the last two years, but its three-year return is superior due to its strong performance in 2022, when it declined by just 2.60%. It's challenging to say whether the managers can repeat this result in a recession. After all, less volatile options are available, including the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), which currently has a 0.90 five-year beta and generally holds higher-quality stocks based on Seeking Alpha Profitability Grades.


PVAL has been one of the top-performing large-cap value ETFs since its launch over three years ago. This performance is impressive because, unlike peers FDVV, DGRW, and CGDV, it has not relied on technology stocks, and from a fund overlap perspective, it would complement any of these ETFs quite well. However, I'm not too enthusiastic about PVAL today because its earnings growth rates and revision scores are less strong than before. Without knowing more about the manager's screening process or current selections, I can't say if these changes are temporary or part of a more problematic downward trend. Still, for investors confident in Putnam Investments, PVAL's value features are solid, and its track record is exemplary, so I've decided to rate it a solid ""hold."" Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731325-financial-institutions-good-dividend-yield-room-for-price-upside-despite-the-recent-rally,4731325,Financial Institutions: Good Dividend Yield; Room For Price Upside Despite The Recent Rally,"Earnings growth of Financial Institutions (NASDAQ:FISI) will likely be flattish to slightly positive in 2024 and 2025. Subdued loan growth and slight margin expansion will likely support the bottom line. As a result, I’m expecting the earnings per share to grow by 0.9% to $3.18 in 2024 and then rise by 1.2% to $3.22 in 2025. Compared to my last report on the company, I’ve raised my earnings estimate because of the non-recurring gain on sales of assets reported in the second quarter results. The December 2025 target price suggests a moderate upside from the current market price. Further, FISI is offering an attractive dividend yield of 4.9%. Based on the total expected return, I’m maintaining a buy rating on Financial Institutions, Inc.
The loan portfolio of Financial Institutions shrank by 1.3% during the third quarter of 2024, which was worse than my expectations given in my last report released in May. The portfolio has declined by 1.2% for the first nine months of 2024, which is especially disappointing considering it has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.6% over the last five years.
The management admitted in the conference call that the commercial pipelines were in a rebuilding phase. Nevertheless, the management is targeting full-year loan growth of 1% - 3% driven by commercial loans. The management believes that demand for commercial loans will pick up with additional interest rate cuts. Please note that commercial is the biggest loan segment for Financial Institutions, so changes in this segment affect total loan growth the most.


Like the management, I too think that monetary easing should drive demand for commercial loans. However, I’m not as optimistic as the management and I think actual loan growth will be near the lower end of the management’s target because the operating environment is currently not as good as it’s been in the past. Financial Institutions operates through its subsidiary, Five Star Bank, in Western and Central New York. It also has some presence in the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly Maryland.
As shown below, New York’s unemployment rate (excluding NYC) has remained stable so far this year at a level higher than the last couple of years. Moreover, Maryland’s unemployment rate has trended upward this year.


Moreover, the coincident indices imply that economic activity in both states is currently flat, even though it’s been growing nationally.


Considering these factors, I’m expecting the loan portfolio to grow by 2.2% in the last quarter, leading to full-year 2024 loan growth of 1.0%. For 2025, I’m expecting a loan growth of 4.1%. Further, I’m expecting deposits to grow in line with loans. The following table shows my balance sheet estimates.
Source: SEC Filings, Analyst's Estimates
(In USD million unless otherwise specified)
Financial Institutions’ net interest margin has been mostly on an uptrend this year after falling by 26 basis points last year. The margin grew by 2 basis points in the third quarter after surging by 9 basis points in the second quarter.
Further margin expansion is likely because a large chunk of low-yielding securities and loans are scheduled to mature soon, which will provide a good opportunity to raise yields through reinvestment. As mentioned in the earnings presentation, the company anticipates receiving more than $1.1 billion in cash flow over the next 12 months from investment securities and loan portfolios. This is a very large number as $1.1 billion is 20.5% of the total earning assets outstanding at the end of September.
Financial Institutions could easily redeploy the funds in higher interest-earning assets. Redeploying in assets carrying yields 50 basis points higher than the yields on outgoing assets could raise the average asset yield, and consequently the margin, by 10 basis points. (Note: calculated as 50 basis points times 20.5%). A difference of 100 basis points in yields between new and outgoing assets could raise the margin by 20 basis points.
Further, interest rate cuts will ease deposit costs, thereby lifting the margin. I’m expecting the Fed to cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points in the last quarter of 2024 following the 50-basis points rate cut in September. Further, I’m expecting the Fed to cut rates by 75-100 basis points in 2025.
Overall, I’m expecting the margin to grow by 2 basis points every quarter through the end of 2025.
To summarize the above discussion, low loan growth and subdued margin expansion will likely lift earnings next year. Additionally, I’m making the following assumptions to forecast earnings.
Overall, the earnings will be somewhat flattish in 2024 and 2025. I’m estimating the company to report earnings per share of $3.18 for 2024, up by just 0.9%. In my last report, I projected earnings of $2.43 per share for 2024. I’ve raised it now, mostly because of the one-time gain on the sale of assets reported for the second quarter.
For 2025, I’m expecting earnings to grow by just 1.2% to $3.22 per share. This is close to my previous estimate of $3.24 per share given in my last report on the company. The following table shows my income statement estimates.
Source: SEC Filings, Earnings Releases, Analyst's Estimates
(In USD million unless otherwise specified)
Financial Institutions’ non-performing loans jumped to 0.93% of total loans by the end of September 2024 from 0.21% of total loans at the end of September 2023. Nevertheless, I’m not too worried. The management mentioned in the conference call that the $31.4 million in non-performing commercial loans as of September 30, 2024, largely related to two separate commercial relationships in outstate New York, which were experiencing issues that were specific to them. Meaning that the problems were not systemic. The management believes it has appropriately reserved for each problem loan.
What is slightly more concerning is that office loans amounted to $360 million at the end of September, which is a sizable 8% of total loans.
The liability and equity side of Financial Institutions’ balance sheet, on the other hand, carries very low risk. Uninsured non-public deposits made up just 18% of total deposits at the end of September. Further, the company reported a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.95%, which is far higher than the well-capitalized threshold of 10.0%
Overall, I think Financial Institutions’ riskiness is moderate.
Financial Institutions is offering an attractive dividend yield of 4.9%, assuming the company maintains its quarterly dividend at the current level of $0.30 per share. The earnings and dividend estimates suggest a payout ratio of 37% for 2025, which is close to the five-year average of 34%. Due to the implied payout ratio, I think the dividend is secure.
Further, there is no pressure on the company to cut back on dividends to boost capital, as its capital ratios are already comfortably higher than regulatory requirements. The company reported a tier I capital ratio of 10.62%, which is higher than the regulatory threshold of 8.0%.
In my last report, which was published in May, I adopted a buy rating with a December 2024 target price of $22.8. Since then, the stock price has rallied by a strong 32% as of the writing of this report. The question arises: is there any upside still left?


I’m using the historical price-to-tangible book (“P/TB”) and price-to-earnings (“P/E”) multiples to value Financial Institutions. The stock has traded at an average P/TB ratio of 1.043x and an average P/E ratio of around 7.338x in the past, as shown below.


Multiplying the average P/TB multiple with the forecast tangible book value per share of $29.3 gives a target price of $30.6 for the end of 2025. This price target implies a 25.0% upside from the October 29 closing price. The following table shows the sensitivity of the target price to the P/TB ratio.
Source: Analyst’s Estimates
Multiplying the average P/E multiple with the forecast earnings per share of $3.22 gives a target price of $23.6 for the end of 2025. This price target implies a 3.5% downside from the October 29 closing price. The following table shows the sensitivity of the target price to the P/E ratio.
Source: Analyst’s Estimates
Equally weighting the target prices from the two valuation methods gives a combined target price of $27.1, which implies a 10.8% upside from the current market price. Adding the forward dividend yield gives a total expected return of 15.7%.
Based on the total expected return, I’m maintaining a buy rating on Financial Institutions. Despite the recent price rally, there seems to be some upside still left for investors.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731324-mondelez-sales-volumes-return-to-growth-but-continuity-is-needed,4731324,"Mondelez: Sales Volumes Return To Growth, But Continuity Is Needed","Q3 2024 results were recently released, and the market does not seem particularly enthusiastic: the price per share remained virtually flat.
In general, there has been no news capable of greatly increasing the volatility of the stock. Revenues continue to grow at mid-single digits, sales volumes are picking up slightly but continue to be rather sluggish. High inflation a few quarters ago led Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) to raise prices in order to preserve margins, and it may have lost some market share.


Both revenues and normalized EPS beat estimates, but GAAP EPS did not.
Mondelez has all the credentials to grow sustainably over the long term, and to achieve this goal it is focusing more on its most important business segments: chocolate, cookies, and backed snacks.


YTD revenues improved by 4%, driven mainly by 6% growth in emerging markets. However, taking a look at volumes, we can see that they declined, so growth was achieved by increasing prices. When I was talking about loss of market share, I was referring to that, which is organic growth not driven by sales volumes.
In any case, on a quarterly basis, there seems to be some improvement. In fact, sales increased by 5.40%, 0.30% of which was due to increased volumes. Wanting to be more precise, the increase came only from developed markets since in emerging markets Mondelez still fails to gain market share.


This difficulty affects all business segments since the beginning of the year, but on a quarterly basis Biscuits & Baked Snacks has returned to growth, +1.10%; Chocolate is down 1.20%; and Gum & Candy is virtually flat, +0.10%.
Failure to improve sales volumes does not mean that Mondelez's brands are no longer liked by consumers, but the company may have pulled too hard on price increases.


High inflation has been the main enemy of almost all companies in previous quarters, but for consumer staples utilizing cocoa there is still a lot of uncertainty. Due to adverse weather conditions, the cocoa harvest was significantly lower than expected and its price skyrocketed. As of today, it seems that the problem is receding, but it remains very expensive compared to 2022 levels.
Europe and North America are the two most important countries for Mondelez, and price increases have been in double digits in past years, so it is not surprising that sales volumes are struggling a bit.


It's difficult to keep prices constant when the price of cocoa triples, but at the same time, as long as Mondelez raises prices that much, I don't see how demand can recover definitively. After all, we already come from a 2022 and a 2023 with big increases, and customers might be interested in other products that are cheaper. For the moment, the latest price increase is proving management right; in fact, volumes in North America and Europe are back to being positive after three quarters. Anyway, the change in consumer habits should not be underestimated.
In Europe, after the further major price increase in Q3 2024, there have been changes in the way consumers buy. In fact, the company observed a greater interest of Europeans in smaller packages and a higher elasticity of demand. This means that at a price increase has a greater negative impact on volumes than in the past.
Let's not forget that the economic situation in Europe is not the best, and Germany is proof of that. Beyond the shrinking GDP, the industrial sector is in deep crisis and double-digit inflation has put a strain on consumer purchasing power.
On the other hand, the United States seems much more resilient, which explains higher sales volumes in Q3 2024. In particular, Oreo and Ritz are gaining market share since the beginning of the year. This is great news as it gives hope on achieving the company's long-term goal: to get 90% of revenues from Chocolate, Cookies and Backed Snacks segment by 2030.
For the target to be reached, management is relying on both organic growth and the acquisition of attractive companies in their local area. Regarding the first factor, organic growth can be achieved by leveraging Mondelez's strongest brands and placing them within strategic partnerships with internationally renowned companies. One example would be the new partnership with Coca-Cola:
Regarding the second factor, management is investing in various companies operating in markets where Mondelez wants to increase its market share:
Regarding this latest acquisition, management is very enthusiastic and sees Evirth as the most reasonable way to grow in China, despite the difficult macroeconomic environment. Its target market is growing in double digits, mainly due to the interest of the new generation:
To be precise, prior to the acquisition, Mondelez already had several business agreements with Evirth and had allowed the marketing of products under the Oreo and Philadelphia brands. Clearly, affairs were going well if the company decided to buy a majority stake in Evirth, which is why I am quite optimistic about a revival of sales volumes in China.
However, to achieve its long-term goal, there are not only acquisitions, but also divestments. Mondelez sold its shares in JDE Peet's to JAB for about $2.40 billion. The reason is that this business was in contradiction with the 2030 goal, in fact, it is involved in selling tea and coffee around the world. This choice reminds me a lot of Unilever's choice related to the sale/spin off of its Ice Cream segment, as it was not able to be leveraged to the fullest with its other business segments. It seems that global consumer staples are doing their best to focus on a few brands but with a strong competitive advantage: increasing margins is more important than increasing sales.
The outlook for FY2024 is not very exciting, and this may be the reason for the lack of market enthusiasm.


Overall, Q3 2024 was positive, albeit with some doubts related to sales volumes. The price of cocoa is still high, but raising prices much further may not be the right strategy. In particular, I am referring to Europe, where demand elasticity is gradually increasing and consumers are buying smaller and smaller packages.
This year the buyback is expected to reach $2 billion, up $500 million from last year, and the dividend is expected to grow for the 10th year in a row.


In terms of valuation, at present, I do not think Mondelez is a buy. It is certainly a solid company, among the most important in its industry, but the current valuation multiples are neither at a discount to peers nor to historical values.


Buying it now, I don't think I would do so at a discount, so I think a hold rating is more appropriate.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731323-apple-hospitality-reit-navigating-near-term-volatility-long-term-gains,4731323,Apple Hospitality REIT: Navigating Near-Term Volatility With Long-Term Gains In Sight,"Shares of Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) have been mostly rangebound over the past six months, sitting in the middle of its 52-week trading range as it consolidates between key support and resistance levels. This presents an attractive entry point, backed by several tailwinds that include a robust recovery in business travel, strategic acquisitions, and disciplined financial management. Moreover, both discounted cash flow (DCF) and dividend valuation models (DVM) point to superb upside potential from current levels. However, with the upcoming earnings report approaching that has faced multiple downward revisions, there is potential for a short-term pullback. Nonetheless, APLE stock remains a compelling long-term opportunity, and waiting for post-earnings clarity may offer an even better entry point.
Apple Hospitality REIT is a top-tier REIT that specializes in the ownership of upscale, room-focused hotels. Boasting a massive portfolio of 224 hotels with over 30,000 guest rooms, Apple focuses on quality and consistency, housing top brands like Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt across 16 management companies.
Moreover, the company’s hotels have an average effective age of just 5 years, shedding light on its commitment to maintaining modern and appealing properties. Its focus on guest satisfaction is underscored further by its impressive 4.3 average TripAdvisor rating. Additionally, last year, APLE posted a superb $1.3 billion in sales and paid out $238.3 million in distributions, showing its robust commitment to shareholder returns. Also, the REIT’s total shareholder return (TSR) outperformed both the MSCI US REIT Index by +21.3 percentage points and the Nareit Lodging/Resorts Index by +26.9 percentage points from 2021-2023.
From the snapshot above, we can see that Apple Hospitality REIT’s geographic diversification spans 87 markets across the U.S., effectively enabling it to tap into a wide range of demand drivers. The diversity in its business reduces reliance on international travel and captures growth from population shifts in business-friendly regions. Moreover, with it generating 47% of its Adjusted Hotel EBITDA from suburban markets and 34% from urban locations, the company maintains a balanced exposure to a variety of location types.
Apple Hospitality REIT exhibits robust FFO growth at $1.671 per share, underscoring its powerful profitability and cash flow management compared to its peers. Coupled with an Altman Z-Score of 1.218, APLE is in excellent financial health, pointing to a substantially lower risk of insolvency and a stable asset base. This combination of healthy FFO and a strong Z-Score underscores APLE's ability to maintain a resilient stance while generating consistent returns amidst market fluctuations.
Furthermore, Apple Hospitality is an excellent income stock, attracting encouraging ratings across key metrics. Following a brief suspension in 2020 on the back of the unprecedented pandemic-led challenges, the REIT demonstrated a swift recovery. By early 2021, the company began reinstating its dividends and has since then been raising its payouts at a gradual pace. Notably, from 2023 onwards, its dividend payments reflect a sturdy return to pre-pandemic levels, with notable peaks.
Moreover, APLE shines with a forward dividend yield of 6.69%, that’s comfortably above the sector median of 4.13%. Also, its forward AFFO yield stands at a solid 8.77%, which is roughly 43% above the sector median, underscoring robust cash flow generation. To round things off, its 5-Year yield on cost of 5.86% shows its consistent long-term income-generating potential.
Furthermore, in terms of dividend safety, the REIT earns a solid B+ grade, reflecting prudent management of payouts and its key liquidity metrics. Its cash dividend payout ratio (TTM) stands at 58.04%, which is considerably lower than the sector median of 62.48%, underscoring a conservative and sustainable payout policy. Additionally, APLE boasts a healthy interest coverage ratio of 3.72, which is 99.24% higher than the sector median. Finally, its net long debt/EBITDA ratio at 308.17% is strikingly better than the sector median of 567.47%, making it one of the most stable companies in its niche.
Apple Hospitality REIT’s results have been relatively solid, and its strategic moves have strengthened its market positioning. Since Q4 2022, the REIT has consistently delivered bottom-line results that either met or exceeded expectations, while consistently pulling ahead in terms of revenue estimates.
During Q2, the company posted $130.09 in Comparable Hotels' RevPAR, marking a 2.5% increase from the prior year. Total revenue came in at $387.1 million, a considerable 2.7% YOY bump. Moreover, adjusted hotel EBITDA reached $151.5 million, with a slight dip in margin by 50 basis points to 39.1%. On a more positive note, modified funds from operations (MFFO) surged by 8.9%, totaling $121.3 million, translating to 50 cents per share.
Apple Hospitality was also able to cash-in on the improved midweek occupancy, on the back of recovering business travel demand, while limiting new supply near 55% of its hotels. Additionally, it scooped up eight hotels from 2023 to 2024 in strengthening its portfolio, while boasting $481 million in available credit, ensuring flexibility for future growth and acquisitions.
Furthermore, in reflecting the choppiness in the current market environment, Apple Hospitality slightly adjusted its 2024 outlook. It lowered its projected net income by $6 million at the midpoint, with the new range set between $202 million and $225 million. Also, it lowered its guidance for comparable hotels RevPAR change by 150 basis points, now expecting growth of 0.5% to 2.5% compared to last year. On the flipside, it raised its comparable hotels adjusted hotel EBITDA margin guidance by 10 basis points, targeting a margin between 35.0% and 35.8%.
One of the big tailwinds discussed in Apple Hospitality’s Q2 report was the significant improvement in weekday occupancy on the back of a stellar recovery in business travel. The chart above highlights the REIT’s robust occupancy trends, showing consistent weekend leisure demand along with improving weekday occupancy levels. This recovery in midweek bookings indicates a superb resurgence in business travel, which is likely to be a major growth driver. Moreover, a recent report from HotelDive, highlighted that global corporate travel spending will likely surpass pre-pandemic levels by 6.2%, hitting $1.5 trillion in 2024. The U.S. leads this growth, with forecasted business travel spending to be at $472 billion, up 13.4% from 2019.
As discussed earlier, APLE stock has remained largely rangebound, ticking up just 0.7% over the past six months, lagging the S&P 500's impressive 14% surge. Similarly, on a YTD basis, the stock has slipped 9%, while the S&P 500 has soared approximately 22.3% over the same period.
The snapshot above shows the candlestick chart of Apple Hospitality REIT stock, highlighting key technical indicators pointing to potential future price action. Currently, APLE stock currently trades around the $15.20 mark, having crossed above the 20-week EMA, but continues facing resistance around the 50-week EMA, which is in a downward direction. This suggests that the medium-term trend remains under bearish pressure, but there is an ongoing attempt at regaining bullish momentum.
We can see from the chart that there have been two major movements in stock prices since March. A 22-week decline of -19.92%, which led to the formation of a key support zone in the $14.00 to $14.50 range. Additionally, there’s been a recent 5-week rise of +13.56%, highlighting a resistance level around $15.50 coinciding with its 50-week EMA. Moreover, the lack of an extreme RSI reading (either above 70 or below 30) suggests that the current consolidation phase is in price action. Investors should look for a sustained breakout above $15.50, which could signal a bullish continuation, potentially targeting the $16.00 level.
Additionally, in arriving at a fair value for APLE stock, I employed both the DVM and DCF analysis, both of which underscore substantial upside potential from its current price.
The snapshot above shows an intrinsic value of $22.65 for APLE stock using a DVM analysis, implying a 49% upside potential. The model uses forward dividend estimates from Seeking Alpha for the current year through 2026, with dividends expected to grow at an adjusted long-term rate of 3%. The required return is set at 7.06%, efficiently aligning with the S&P 500’s long-term average. Moreover, the terminal value is calculated based on projected dividends, adjusted for perpetual growth. The approach effectively captures APLE's future cash flows through dividends, aligning its valuation with shareholder returns.
Moreover, the massive upside is supported by my DCF analysis of the stock. The model uses an after-tax weighted-average-cost-of-capital (WACC) value of 8.43%, based on a 5-year monthly beta value of around 0.87, and debt and equity weights at 30.2% and 69.8%, respectively.
With these metrics in play, we arrive at a fair value of $23.26 per share, pointing to a substantial 53% upside from current levels. This analysis factors in a growth rate of 4%, aligning with conservative long-term projections. The model also considers a terminal growth rate of 4%, indicating modest, steady growth beyond the forecasted period. Moreover, its discounted terminal value is assessed using an exit multiple of 14.03, which efficiently aligns with the sector median price-to-FFO ratio, ensuring a more market-aligned valuation.
Despite the appeal of APLE stock, it is imperative to consider the risks. Firstly, the upcoming earnings report could potentially result in a considerable sell-off, especially with multiple downward revisions hinting at near-term volatility.
Moreover, while the recovery in business travel looks much more promising than before, any hiccups in the macroeconomic environment, including heightened interest rates or geopolitical tensions, could result in more bearish momentum ahead. Also, it’s imperative to consider the competition in the hospitality space, with new supply, especially post-interest rate cuts, which could weigh down pricing power. Finally, APLE's outlook banks on steady economic growth, but a dip in consumer spending could strain the REIT’s fundamentals.
Apple Hospitality REIT presents an attractive long-term opportunity, backed by healthy fundamentals, a strong dividend yield, and strategic acquisitions fueling its expansion. Despite the recent rangebound trading activity and short-term risks linked to upcoming earnings, the REIT’s effective financial management and recovery in business travel position it for future upside. Both valuation models point to significant undervaluation, offering double-digit upside potential from current price levels. Moreover, despite the macroeconomic uncertainty, APLE stock remains a compelling and resilient income-generating stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731318-hess-midstream-operations-are-great-and-are-overshadowed-by-the-acquisition,4731318,Hess Midstream Operations Are Great And Overshadowed By The Acquisition,"The last article noted that Hess Midstream insiders are selling in some extremely significant quantities. This article will concentrate on the lack of profits that Hess (HES) reports for the business that Hess Midstream (NYSE:HESM) services. As was expected, management reported during the conference call that everything remains on track and provided a rosy picture several years out. However, the reporting by Hess shows that the overall upstream picture is not all that profitable. Therefore, the rosy picture painted by Hess Midstream management can quickly come undone if the profitability issue is not tackled.
Hess reports its quarterly results by geographic area as follows:


It is extremely clear that the United States business is not very profitable and really has not been for some time. The question Hess Midstream shareholders need to answer is whether or not costs can line up in the future (whatever that future is) in a way that makes the United States business more profitable so that the midstream business retains that rosy future management is guiding to.
The large majority of the business is in the Bakken which is where the Hess Midstream business is located. Clearly, the company should be making money on this business in the current commodity price environment. If this cannot be fixed, then the sale of these assets or the discontinuance of the business is a logical decision. Both of those would involve a lot of uncertainty for Hess Midstream.
From a shareholder's perspective, this also would be a reason why insiders are selling in such large quantities. They are getting out while ""the getting is good"". From the conference call, Hess is maintaining its holding percentage in the midstream company. But that does not eliminate the fact that Hess has made a lot of money selling some of its holdings. Previous corporate presentations have estimated total savings in the billions. (Hess removed the slides with the acquisition offer pending). Even if the operations ceased ""tomorrow"" it is likely that Hess has made an overall profit from the situation.
Here is a slide from a while back on the value of Hess Midstream to Hess:


Note that there have been more transactions since then. So, the value really has not declined materially. It may have switched, however, from one number to the other.
Management may well have another reason, such as the other significant insider was always going to ""want out"" and is doing exactly what was planned years ago. Hess has maintained is roughly 38% holding percentage through these buybacks while GLP, the other major founding partner, is now down to 15% of the shares outstanding according to the conference call. Note that these are rounded percentages. GLP is likely to keep going until it is completely gone because it is a fund that typically cashes out at a certain point. The last article showed the NASDAQ where it was the major insider seller.
But as the last article noted, shareholders have to decide if they want to remain in the current situation because the overall business results are unsatisfactory. Many times, the business threat to a captive midstream (which is one with one customer) is the parent company rather than the actual business itself.
Whether Hess remains independent or gets acquired by Chevron (CVX) as planned does not seem to alter the choice set much. What does appear to be important is that Chevron would be far less likely to put up with the Hess results? What action Chevron would decide to take is up for debate. The unknown in a situation like that is probably far too great for income investors.
The other thing discussed during the conference call was the share repurchases that the midstream company has been doing. So far, the large majority of the purchases have come whenever the insiders' sales have been announced. Those purchases were a part of the insider sale process. Management emphasized the increasing liquidity that these sales (net of repurchases) will generate. But that only provides a more favorable environment for more insider sales.
When shareholders think about a management that represents shareholder interests, they first need to look at where most of the shares are held. In this case, insiders still own most of the shares. Therefore, the management priority is really to those big shareholders (likely at the expense of public shareholders).
That means that public shareholders are likely ""on their own"" because the majority rules.
The management reported guidance for continuing volume growth and some capital projects clear out to 2027. This is an attempt to reassure the public about the future of the company. It may actually happen the way management forecasts the future. But the public needs to evaluate all the possibilities to decide if the level of risk of an unfavorable future outcome is rising to unacceptable levels.
Volume growth and rig activity were encouraging. The business is expected to be such that the dividend can continue to be raised every quarter, along the lines of the current strategy.
The ""take or pay"" aspect of the business was emphasized as well. However, in the overall picture of the business, any midstream profits are likely seen as a decrease in transportation expenses by Hess. Therefore, those expenses are part of the decision as to what to do in the future when the time comes to make the decision. They are not the reason to avoid the decision altogether.
Similarly, the debt ratio is very conservative. But it is rising as the share repurchases are mainly financed with debt. Over time, there have been far more shares repurchased than there have been debt payments since I have begun covering this issue. That means another area of concern would be future debt levels and how that impacts any future decisions about this business.
Hess Midstream has a fantastic business at the present time. It would be hard to find a more efficient operator. However, the threat to the business is coming from the lack of profits that Hess is reporting for the United States business (which is mostly this part of the business).
The situation makes a far more complicated investment decision than is the case for many midstream companies. For me, this is a strong sell because the overall business is not profitable, and I can find other midstream opportunities without this issue. I view the stock as fairly priced and so would only miss the dividend increases that are projected, and the capital gains associated with that.
However, I view the positives missed as far less potential than the risk of an unfavorable decision (especially from Chevron, which is very profit oriented) in the future. Obviously, at least one insider wants out. That likely means that the stock is going nowhere because the minute the market absorbs the last public offering there will likely be another public offering. I do not see the need to help finance that strategy by buying or owning shares.
One thing about this situation is that Hess Midstream could emerge unscathed from this with a growing future. But I suspect the insiders have already ""banked"" a minimum profit on the situation no matter the outcome. The question remains should you, the investor, follow their lead?
Obviously, the biggest risk here is whatever Hess or Chevron decides to do to either increase Bakken profits, sell the business, or shut the business down completely. The lack of profits shown by the business, as Hess reports, it is unacceptable to remain status quo. The midstream business is heavily dependent upon one main customer, and that customer is about to get acquired by Chevron. Chevron demands a return on all their businesses. This business is a rounding error to a company the size of Chevron.
As far as the midstream business itself goes, as long as the business exists as it currently does, that business has very good visibility and downside protection from ""take or pay"" contracts. It is known as the utility business of the industry due to the steadiness of the business.
The only real serious risk of the business is a safety issue. But so far, the company has had tremendous success in avoiding major safety issues. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that in the future something will not happen that could cost the midstream a lot of money.
A loss of key personnel could materially set back the company plans.

I have covered Enovix Corporation or ""Enovix"" (NASDAQ:ENVX) previously, so investors should view this as an update to my earlier articles on the company.
After the close of Tuesday's regular session, advanced lithium-ion battery manufacturer Enovix reported Q3/2024 results very much in line with muted expectations:


As the company continues to invest in its Malaysian manufacturing operations, cash burn remains elevated. Once again, Enovix used more than $50 million in cash and finished the quarter with $201 million in cash and cash equivalents, as well as $185 million in debt.
While the company's financial performance was nothing to write home about, investors cheered the announcement of a new development agreement with a leading Chinese smartphone OEM:
In the earnings press release, management also highlighted progress with a ""leading IoT customer"" and in the electric vehicle (""EV"") space.
The company is advancing towards mass production of its EX-1M battery, which is currently projected for late 2025. However, the required high volume manufacturing line is still undergoing site acceptance testing, which is expected to be completed by year-end.
On the conference call, management elaborated in great detail on the company's future prospects and the recent ""pivotal"" launch of its manufacturing operations in Malaysia.
However, the company's contract manufacturing agreement with YBS International Berhad (""YBS"") doesn't seem to have played out as initially expected as disclosed in the company's quarterly report on form 10-Q (emphasis added by author):
Please note that I have scrutinized the rather uncommon terms of the agreement in the past already.
For my part, I am surprised that management abstained from discussing this important development in the press release or on the conference call.
As Enovix filed its 10-Q after Tuesday's conference call, analysts didn't have the chance to ask questions on this topic either.
At least in my opinion, the requirement to fully finance the high volume manufacturing line might have caused the decision to raise additional capital:
While the requirement to raise more capital over time hasn't been a secret, some investors will likely take issue with management's statements during the question-and-answer session of the conference call (emphasis added by author):
Quite frankly, it seems like management finished its evaluation rather quickly, and apparently dilution was the only option available to the company at this point.
At the current rate of cash usage, the new capital would be exhausted within two quarters, but anticipated lower capex levels should help reduce quarterly cash burn to an estimated range of $30 million to $35 million next year.
That said, in the end it all comes down to Enovix' ability to
At this point, management still has much to accomplish for the company to come even close to its ambitious targets for 2026:


For my part, I remain skeptical of the Enovix story, which is already years behind the original business plan, and wouldn't be surprised to see additional delays going forward.


In addition, I am struggling with the decision to abstain from discussing substantial changes to the Malaysian contract manufacturing agreement and the way management handled the capital raise question on the conference call.
Consequently, I am reiterating my ""Sell"" rating on the shares.
Enovix reported Q3/2024 results in line with muted expectations and announced a new development agreement with a leading Chinese smartphone OEM. On the conference call, management reiterated expectations for high volume manufacturing to ramp in late 2025 and rising exponentially in 2026.
While investors celebrated the news in after hours, the stock finished Wednesday's session in the red, likely due to Cantor Fitzgerald already marketing the offering to selected clients.
At least in my opinion, management's performance on the conference call left much to be desired as the CFO created the impression that there won't be a near-term capital raise and abstained from openly discussing the requirement to fund an additional $70 million in capex for the company's first high-volume manufacturing line.
For my part, I remain skeptical of the Enovix story, which is already years behind the original business plan and wouldn't be surprised to see additional delays going forward.
Consequently, I am reiterating my ""Sell"" rating on the shares.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731322-job-openings-decrease-in-september,4731322,Job Openings Decrease In September,"By Jennifer Nash
The latest job openings and labor turnover summary (JOLTS) report showed that job openings decreased slightly in September, reflecting less hiring. Vacancies decreased to 7.846 million in September from August's downwardly revised level of 7.998 million. The latest reading was less than the expected 7.980 million vacancies.
From the press release:
The JOLTS report is a monthly survey of job openings, hiring, and job separations (quits, layoffs, discharges) released by the BLS. Unlike the unemployment rate that measures the supply side of the labor market, JOLTS data helps gauge labor demand.
The chart below shows the monthly data points of the four components of the JOLTS series. They are quite volatile, hence the inclusion of six-month moving averages to help identify the trends.
The moving average for openings was above the hires levels for over five years starting in 2015, as seen in the chart below. The openings MA briefly dipped below the hires for two months (May and June 2020), only to climb above once more in July 2020.
Over the last year, job openings, hires, and quits have all been trending down with job openings moving falling the fastest. During that same time, layoffs and discharges have been slowly trending up but have recently started to level off.

For comparison, here is the monthly BLS Employment Situation Summary charted with JOLTS data:

In September, there were 6.834 million unemployed workers and 7.846 million job openings. This equates to 1.09 jobs available per unemployed worker in September, down slightly from August.

The chart above is based on the actual numbers in the JOLTS report. A better way to view the numbers is as a percent of non-farm employment, which essentially gives us a population-adjusted version of the data. Here is that adjustment for four of the JOLTS series. The vertical axis for each is optimized for the high-low range to facilitate an understanding of the individual trends.




Based on the six-month moving averages, we can see that:
To reiterate a previous point: Increases in quits suggest employment flexibility. Quits tend to be inversely correlated with layoffs & discharges, which are associated with business cycle weakness. Following the Great Recession, quits began increasing in 2010, and the rate accelerated in 2013 and continued to rise until the COVID pandemic.
As the economy rebounded from the COVID downturn, we saw quits reach an all-time high in November 2021 and again in March 2022 in what has been called ""The Great Resignation"".
Layoffs & discharges fell post Great Recession and leveled out for many years. Due to the COVID pandemic, layoffs and discharges saw all-time highs but are now making their way back to pre-pandemic levels.

It would, of course, be excellent if we had historical JOLTS data stretching back through several business cycles. However, the BLS only began tracking this data in December 2000.
The time frame is quite limited compared to the main BLS data series in the monthly employment report, many of which go back to 1948, and the enormously popular non-farm employment (PAYEMS) series goes back to 1939. Nevertheless, there are some clear JOLTS correlations with the most recent business cycle trends.
The JOLTS reports is interesting to watch, but the volatility of the data, which is also subject to revisions, encourages caution in taking the data for any given month very seriously.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731313-bimbos-ongoing-issues-in-the-us-drive-a-pretty-stale-outlook,4731313,Grupo Bimbo's Ongoing Issues In The U.S. Drive A Pretty Stale Outlook,"Grupo Bimbo (OTCQX:GRBMF) (OTCQX:BMBOY) is a case in point as to how dropping the ball in one area of the business can largely cancel out progress made elsewhere in the business. The operations in Mexico continue to perform well, with share gains on top of category growth, and there are positives in the Latin American and European/Asian operations, but ongoing share loss in the U.S. and the cost of transformation/restructuring efforts continue to weigh on overall results.
Bimbo shares are down about 9% since my last update on the company (and the ADRs are down a high-teens percentage), meaningfully underperforming the 3% gain in the S&P Food & Beverage Select Index as well as the more modest 3% decline at Flowers Foods (FLO) as the company continues to see share and margin erosion in the U.S. business.
Management seems to finally be getting more active on promotional efforts in the U.S., while also closing bakeries and looking to further streamline operations, and I like the prospects for ongoing share gains in Mexico and scale growth/leverage outside these markets. Moreover, the valuation does not seem particularly high if 4% revenue growth and mid-single-digit free cash flow margins are realistic long-term targets. I can see some appeal here for more patient value/turnaround investors, but I'd like to see more evidence of stabilization in the U.S. business before getting more bullish.
Bimbo's third quarter results don't lend themselves to simple takeaways, as there were positives and negatives across the business. Revenue was as expected overall, but ongoing weakness in the North American (U.S. and Canada) segment remains a concern. Likewise with overall margins, though spending on restructuring efforts in the North American operations are weighing results and arguably aren't ""core"" from a long-term perspective.
Revenue rose more than 7% as reported (in line with sell-side expectations) and a little less than 1% in constant currency. The North American business was the main drag, with sales up 6% as reported by down more than 4% in local currency on volume-driven share loss in the U.S. market. Sales in Mexico were up close to 7%, while the Latin America and Europe, Asia, and Africa (or EAA) businesses saw better than 7% constant-currency growth.
Gross margin rose 150bp to 53.1%, helped in part by mix and scale, but more significantly by raw material cost declines. Wheat futures have been bouncing along five-year lows for much of this year, allowing Bimbo to lock in good prices, but I'm reticent to just assume significant further tailwinds (allowing that commodity prices are incredibly difficult to forecast).
EBITDA rose 8% as reported (up more than 3% in constant currency), with margin up 10bp from the prior year and 50bp from the prior quarter to 14.7%. EBITDA from the Mexico operations rose 15%, with margin up 130bp to 21.9%, and the EAA business saw a significant jump (up 58%), with margin up 240bp to 10%. The North America business saw an 8% decline as reported (17% in constant currency) with margin down 140bp to 9.5%.
While EBITDA was a little better than expected (about 2%-5% depending on which data aggregator you use), EBIT was an 8% miss and I think the 4% decline in EBIT (almost 7% in constant currency) is more reflective of real underlying performance. The U.S. business declined 43% as reported (almost 49% in constant currency) on facility closures and restructuring (or ""investments in the value chain""), and while management characterizes these as one-time items, the reality is that restructuring has been a nearly continuous process, so I'm less inclined to just ignore these costs.
When I last wrote about Bimbo in June, I was already concerned about Bimbo's performance in the U.S. market, as Nielsen data showed the company losing share not only to private label offerings (a fairly common occurrence across the industry for some time now), but also rivals like Flowers and Lancaster Colony (LANC).
Those numbers have since gotten worse, with trailing 12-month performance through early October showing a roughly 3% decline in sales (versus flat sales for the trailing 12 months ending in June) and a roughly three-point underperformance to the industry (versus around one point previously). The losses have been on the volume side, and the company continues to underperform private label and Flowers in its key bread category, with some other smaller niches (like buns) doing even worse.
Management seems to finally be responding to these share losses, noting increased promotion and price reduction activity. A better raw material cost environment and ongoing investments in the supply chain (as well as closing underperforming facilities) should offset some of the margin risk to lowering prices, but I'm still concerned that the company has waited too long to respond to increased cost-consciousness from consumers and the share losses may be expensive to reverse.
The news is better outside the North American operations.
The business continues to perform pretty well in Mexico despite a more challenging consumer environment, and Bimbo continues to ride a positive long-term cycle of increased bread consumption (relative to tortillas) over the last two decades, as the category has grown at a high single-digit rate for quite some time. Price sensitivity is an issue in the near term, and talk of the Mexican government looking to once again subsidize tortillas could threaten to reverse some bread share gains, but I continue to see credible long-term growth opportunities here, particularly as Bimbo's share is likely just in the high teens (small ""artisanal"" players control most of the market).
I'm also cautiously bullish on the operations in EAA. Management continues to use M&A to build scale, most recently in Southeast Europe (the acquisition of Don Don), and Bimbo has been riding the ongoing growth of quick service restaurants in markets like China to grow the business.
I don't like the ongoing market share dynamics in the U.S. market, nor the higher debt load in recent quarters (with the company spending on M&A and capex), but neither are unfixable issues. If management can thread the needle of offering more compelling pricing/value to consumers without compromising its pricing power too much, I think the share issues can be fixed.
That said, it feels like the North American operations have been in a perpetual state of turnaround and restructuring, and margins here have actually been sliding since 2020 (from 12.9% to 9.4% for the nine months of 2024). While the trajectory of overall margins has been a little better, consistent execution remains an issue.
I still think that Bimbo can grow its revenue at a long-term rate of around 4%, with ongoing share growth opportunities in Mexico, Latin America, Asia, and Europe. I likewise still see opportunities to drive better operating scale and leverage successful products across multiple geographies. I'm less confident on the margin outlook, but I do think long-term FCF margins in the neighborhood of 5% to 6% are possible (against a long-term average closer to 3.5%).
If Bimbo can get there, the shares do offer some upside on a discounted cash flow analysis. Likewise, a 7.5x multiple on 2025 EBITDA supports a fair value roughly 20% higher than today's price - 7.5x may be a bit of a stretch now given the market share issues in the U.S. and the inconsistency of margins, but it's not an unreasonable multiple looking at global comps.
The underperformance in these shares has made them a little more interesting, but I still have concerns about the market share situation in the U.S., and if raw material tailwinds would flip to headwinds, or if there would be further issues and complications in the ongoing North American restructuring / improvement efforts, the impact to overall margins and cash flow generation could be pretty unpleasant.
Given those concerns, I'm staying on the sidelines for now, and I really want to see stabilized, if not improved, market share performance in the U.S. before getting more bullish.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731312-gdp-prints-at-2-8-percent-as-markets-and-analysts-await-inflation-jobs-data,4731312,"GDP Prints At 2.8% As Markets And Analysts Await Inflation, Jobs Data","NEW YORK (October 30) - Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, for the Third Quarter of 2024 (""2024 Q3"") printed this morning at a less-than-anticipated 2.8% rate of annual growth. Consensus estimates had put the figure at 3.0%. The print was about 60 basis points (bps) above the upper range of our last prognostication of growth, 2% (+/-25 bps), but below the and within the upper limit of the range of the ""Blue Chip"" consensus tracked by the St. Louis Fed.
Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (""Core PCE"") printed at 2.7% for August. September’s number will be released tomorrow, October 31. (Core PCE is reportedly the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.)
Let's look at our exclusive chart of 2024 Q3 GDP by Major Component:


The components of GDP are mostly unremarkable, driven, as usual, by Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE. It is notable, however, that the 85 bps growth in Government Consumption Expenditures, or GCE, was the biggest increase in that sector of GDP since 2022Q4. It is attributable to a 60 bps increase in federal government spending and a 25 bps increase in state and local spending.
The 2024 Q3 GDP release is one of those few occasions when economic data comes like a major league fastball: rapidly and hard. Tomorrow, we’ll see inflation data; then, Friday, we’ll see the October jobs data.
Moreover, all of this data comes just days before the 2024 presidential and Congressional elections, so some of it could sway the few remaining undecided voters and, with them, the election. The FOMC doesn’t meet again until December 17th and 18th.
As of now, our model shows 2024 Q4 GDP at 2.25%, +/- 25 bps. But that can change with Friday’s data. Accordingly, we’re holding off our usual prognostications, including an update of geopolitical risk, until Friday’s jobs report is released. We usually submit our analysis for publication the same day.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731305-talkspace-stock-jumpstarting-momentum-as-payor-programs-expand,4731305,Talkspace: Jumpstarting Momentum As Payor Programs Expand,"Earnings season is now in full swing, and despite concerns of a potential macro slowdown particularly for consumer-facing companies, a number of discarded growth stocks have also gotten a chance to shine and prove their worth to investors in Q3.
Talkspace (NASDAQ:TALK), the telehealth app that connects patients to mental health providers, is one such example. After making meaningful strides in profitability in Q3, shares soared nearly 20%, bringing Talkspace into a true rebound rally. It has now shaken off its year-to-date declines, and the stock is now up more than 30% YTD.


I last wrote a bullish note on Talkspace in August, when the stock was still trading just below $2 per share. At the time, I had called out the stock’s hyper-growth, its expansion into Medicare, and an incredibly low valuation below <1x forward revenue as one of the core reasons to buy in. Though Talkspace is more expensive now, it still has a ways to go in attaining a “normal” revenue valuation multiple. In light of this and strong results, I’m reiterating my buy rating on the company.
It’s remarkable to see the double-digit growth in this relatively small company as a result of two tectonic shifts: increased need and acceptance of mental health care among consumers, as well as more employers’ and insurance plans’ willingness to pay for mental health treatment. This goes beyond the corporate sphere: the company has made major inroads with the military of late, signing a deal with the U.S. Navy to provide mental health access to 25,000 sailors on six naval bases. The company is also rolling out a program to cover active military personnel and expects to cover all TRICARE beneficiaries (health services plan for the military) by early 2035. These tailwinds have fed a large expansion in the company’s “covered lives,” while Talkspace has also entered into meaningful strategic partnerships with companies like Amazon (AMZN), wherein Amazon users will soon be able to check their mental health coverage eligibility via a search on Amazon Health.
As a reminder for investors who are newer to Talkspace, here’s a refresher on what I view to be the long-term bull case for the company:
Stay long here and keep riding Talkspace’s strong momentum post-earnings.
Let’s now go through Talkspace’s latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below:


Talkspace’s revenue grew 23% y/y to $47.4 million, though we note that this was only essentially in-line with Wall Street’s expectations of $47.5 million and decelerated six points relative to 29% growth in Q2. As a refresher here, the company’s core strategic focus over the past year has been to move away from marketing to individual consumers and instead to appeal to enterprise health plans and insurance providers, which in turn market Talkspace’s services to their members. Revenue to payors grew 45% y/y and enterprise was up 17% y/y, while direct consumer revenue declined -30% y/y.
The number of total “covered lives,” meanwhile, jumped 40% y/y to 160 million eligible Americans. The company’s expansion of its Medicare coverage continues to be one of the biggest driving forces for its growth in Payor revenue. Per CEO Jon Cohen’s remarks on the Q3 earnings call surrounding the ongoing Medicare rollout:
Medicare coverage, plus the expanded push into the military TRICARE program, will be major drivers for growth in 2025.
And on the profitability front, we especially applaud the fact that in spite of Talkspace's double-digit revenue growth, the company was actually able to reduce opex by -10% y/y, down to just 41% of revenue. As a result, as shown in the chart below, adjusted EBITDA jumped to a profit of $2.4 million (5% margin), doubling sequentially and comparing quite favorably to a -$2.8 million loss (-7% margin) in the year-ago Q3.


In spite of Talkspace's sharp rally since mid-summer, the stock still trades at a reasonable valuation profile, especially in light of its current pace of growth. At current share prices just over $3, Talkspace trades at a market cap of $534.9 million. After we net off the $119.0 million of cash on the company's latest balance sheet, the company's resulting enterprise value is $415.9 million.
Meanwhile, for next fiscal year FY25, Wall Street analysts are expecting Talkspace to generate $231.1 million in revenue, or 22% y/y growth against the midpoint of the company's $185-$195 million guidance range for the current year. This positions Talkspace's valuation at just 1.8x EV/FY25 revenue: which, for a company with 20%+ revenue growth and ongoing growth catalysts (Medicare, TRICARE program rollouts) as well as burgeoning adjusted EBITDA profitability, is quite a bargain.
Stay long here and keep riding Talkspace's post-earnings momentum upward.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731354-consumers-splurge-q3-durable-goods-drive-gdp-growth-debt-to-gdp-ratio-worsens,4731354,"Consumers Splurge In Q3, Phenomenally So On Durable Goods, Drive GDP Growth; But Debt-To-GDP Ratio Worsens","Jump in government spending also boosted GDP growth. But surging imports, falling residential fixed investments, and inventories dragged.
Consumers were at it again, and they splurged on goods in particular, but also on services, and they accounted for 69% of GDP, and they moved the GDP needle, driven by big increases in income, and saved the rest.
A much smaller group of consumers also dug deeply into their pockets to spend money, but they had to borrow a bunch of it, thereby further ballooning the national debt and driving the debt-to-GDP ratio higher.
What dragged on GDP: The trade deficit worsened further, driven by rampant consumer spending and expected consumer spending on goods, a portion of which are imported. Companies were front-loading imports for the holiday season to not get caught up in a potentially long strike at East Coast ports. Slower growth in private inventory investment also dragged on GDP.
So GDP, adjusted for inflation (“real GDP”), grew by an annualized rate of 2.8% in Q3 from Q2, well above the 15-year pre-pandemic average of 2.0%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Wednesday. By comparison, in Q2, GDP grew by 3.0%, and in Q1 by 1.6%. Year-over-year, GDP grew by 2.7%.
By major category, adjusted for inflation, in annual rates:


“Real” GDP in dollar terms, adjusted for inflation and expressed in 2017 dollars, rose to $23.4 trillion annualized in Q3. A month ago, the BEA heavily revised upward the prior years of GDP, consumer income, consumer spending, and the savings rate. The blue line shows GDP before that revision:


The actual size of the US economy: “Current-dollar” GDP (not adjusted for inflation and expressed in current dollars) rose by 4.9%, to $29.4 trillion annualized. This is the amount we use for the US debt-to-GDP ratio here further down.
Consumer spending on goods and services rose by 3.7% in Q3 from Q2 annualized and adjusted for inflation, the fastest rate of growth since Q1 2023 and the second fastest since Q4 2021, powered by phenomenal spending growth on durable goods.
Retail sales data - sales of goods, not services - released earlier in October, including large up-revisions of prior months, pointed the way with a three-month annualized growth rate, not adjusted for inflation, of 7.0%.
Consumer spending - personal consumption expenditures, as they’re called officially - accounted for 69% of GDP.


Private Fixed investment rose by 1.3%, annualized and adjusted for inflation, decelerating from the prior two quarters (Q2 +2.3%, Q1 +6.5%). Of which:


Government consumption expenditures and gross investment jumped by 5.0% annualized and adjusted for inflation, a further acceleration from Q2 (+3.1%) and Q1 (+1.8%).
Federal, state, and local government consumption and investment accounts for 17% of GDP (with state and local governments accounting for 61% of total government spending, and the federal government accounting for 39%).
This does not include interest payments, and it does not include transfer payments (the biggest part of which are Social Security payments), which are counted in GDP if and when consumers and businesses spend these funds or invest them in fixed investments.


Consumers vs. Governments. Consumer spending accounts for 69% of GDP, and the percentage increase moves the needle much more than the combined federal, state, and local government spending (which accounts for only 17% of GDP) because it comes off a much larger base.
Personal consumption expenditures (+3.0%) contributed 2.46 percentage points to the GDP growth of 2.8%.
Federal, state, and local, government consumption expenditures and investment (+5.0%) contributed only 0.85 percentage points to the GDP growth of 2.8%.
This chart shows both, consumer spending (blue) and government spending (red) in inflation-adjusted dollars at annual rates. Remember that big parts of government spending, including interest expense, do not enter into GDP and economic growth. They only enter indirectly if and when the recipients spend them or invest them in fixed investments:


The Trade Deficit (“net exports”) in goods & services worsened further for the third consecutive quarter:


The Debt-to-GDP ratio worsened a tad to 120.8% in Q3 because the gross national debt in current dollars (not adjusted for inflation) grew even faster than GDP in current dollars (not adjusted for inflation). By contrast, in Q2, GDP had grown a little faster than the debt, and the Debt-to-GDP ratio had dipped a little. For the past four quarters, the debt-to-GDP ratio hovered at just over 120%, despite the strong economy:
